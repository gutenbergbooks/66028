<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT (Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence): Dr. Seidl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED SEIDL (Counsel for Defendant Hans Frank):
Mr. President, Members of the Tribunal, on 9 April of this year,
deviating from the rule made by the Tribunal, I made the application
that I should first be allowed to present the documents, then
call the witnesses, and then at the end examine the defendant as a
witness. I do not know whether the Tribunal is already in possession
of the document books. I have ascertained that Volume I of the
document book was translated by 8 April, Volume II and III on
11 April, and Volume IV and V a few days later. At any rate, I
have not yet received any document books myself, for the reason
that the office concerned has not yet received permission to bind
the books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I thought I asked about this, not yesterday,
but the day before yesterday—yes; and you said you were
perfectly ready to go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I had been told that the books had been translated,
and I naturally assumed that these books would also be bound.
Yesterday I discovered that this is not the case. At any rate, the
fault is not mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I was not suggesting that there was any fault
on your part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. THOMAS J. DODD (Executive Trial Counsel for the United
States): In the first place, we did not have much to go over with
Dr. Seidl. The agreement was reached with him the night before
last about 6 o’clock or a little afterwards. Thereafter the materials
were put into the process of preparation, and there are 500 pages.
They have just not been completed, and it is not so that the people
did not receive authority to go ahead. They have not been able to
complete their work and there will be some delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, you can go on with your witnesses.
You have the defendant himself to call and several other witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And the documents will no doubt be ready
by then. We are rising this evening at half past four, and by the
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
time that the Tribunal reassembles, by Tuesday morning, no doubt
all the documents will be ready. As to your application, the Tribunal
has considered the application and sees no reason to depart from its
ordinary rule that the defendant should be called first; that is to say,
if you intend to call the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Oh yes, I intend to examine the defendant; but in
the interests of accelerating the proceedings, I suggested that the
other witnesses should be heard first so that the examination of the
defendant might be as short as possible. It is possible that he can
then answer a number of questions merely by saying “yes” or “no.”
Another reason why I consider this procedure to be the most expedient
is because a proper examination of the defendant is only
possible if I have the document books at hand at the same time.
That necessity does not apply to the other witnesses. I should, therefore,
beg the Tribunal to give me permission so that I can first
examine the witnesses who are already in the witnesses’ room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The documents are all, or nearly all, I imagine,
in German and can be put to the defendant in the course of his
examination; and the Tribunal think, as they have already said, that
calling the defendant first is in the interests of expedition; and they,
therefore, feel they must adhere to their rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Very well. In that case, with the permission of the
Tribunal, I call the Defendant Dr. Hans Frank to the witness stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Frank took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you give your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HANS FRANK (Defendant): Hans Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, swear by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak
the pure truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you sit down, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, when and where were you born?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was born on 23 May 1900 at Karlsruhe, in Baden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Will you please give the Tribunal a brief outline of
your education?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In 1919 I finished my studies at the Gymnasium, and in
1926 I passed the final state law examination, which completed my
legal training.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: And what profession did you follow after that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I had several legal posts. I worked as a lawyer; as a
member of the teaching staff of a technical college; and then I worked
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
principally as legal adviser to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist
German Workers Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Since when have you been a member of the NSDAP?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I joined the German Labor Party, which was the
forerunner of the National Socialist German Workers Party, in 1919,
but did not join the newly formed National Socialist Workers Party
at the time. In 1923 I joined the Movement in Munich as a member
of the SA; and eventually, so to speak, I joined the NSDAP for the
first time in 1927.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Were you ever a member of the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I have never been a member of the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: That means you have never had a rank of an SS
Obergruppenführer or General of the SS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I never had the rank of an SS Obergruppenführer or
SS General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Not even honorary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No, not even honorary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You were a member of the SA. What was the last
position you held in that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was Obergruppenführer in the SA at the end, and
this was an honorary position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What posts did you hold in the NSDAP during the
various periods, and what functions did you exercise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In 1929 I became the head of the legal department of
the Supreme Party Directorate of the NSDAP. In that capacity I
was appointed Reichsleiter of the NSDAP by Adolf Hitler in 1931. I
held this position until I was recalled in 1942. These are the principal
offices I have held in the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Until the seizure of power you concerned yourself
mainly with legal questions within the Party, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I dealt with legal questions in the interest of Adolf
Hitler and the NSDAP and its members during the difficult years of
struggle for the victory of the Movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What were your basic ideas regarding the concept
of a state controlled by a legal system?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That idea, as far as I was concerned, was contained in
Point 19 of the Party program, which speaks of German common
law to be created. In the interest of accelerating the proceedings, I
do not wish to present my ideas in detail. My first endeavor was
to save the core of the German system of justice: the independent
judiciary.
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My idea was that even in a highly developed Führer State, even
under a dictatorship, the danger to the community and to the legal
rights of the individual is at least lessened if judges who do not
depend on the State Leadership can still administer justice in the
community. That means, to my mind, that the question of a state
ruled by law is to all intents and purposes identical with the question
of the existence of the independent administration of law. Most
of my struggles and discussions with Hitler, Himmler, and Bormann
during these years were more and more focused on this particular
subject. Only after the independent judiciary in the National
Socialist Reich had been definitely done away with did I give up my
work and my efforts as hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You were also a member of the Reichstag?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In 1930 I became a member of the Reichstag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What posts did you hold after 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: First, I was Bavarian State Minister of Justice, and
after the ministries of justice in the various states were dissolved I
became Reich Minister without portfolio. In 1933 I became the
President of the Academy of German Law, which I had founded. I
was the Reich Leader of the National Socialist Jurists Association,
which was later on given the name of “Rechtswahrerbund.” In 1933
and 1934 I was Reich Commissioner for Justice, and in 1939 I became
Governor General of the Government General in Kraków.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What were the aims of the Academy of German Law
of which you were the founder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: These aims are written down in the Reich Law regarding
the Academy of German Law. The main task, the central task,
of that Academy was to carry out Point 19 of the Party program to
bring German Common Law into line with our national culture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did the Academy of German Law have definite
functions, or could it act only in an advisory capacity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The Academy of German Law was the meeting place
of the most prominent legal minds in Germany in the theoretical
and practical fields. Right from the beginning I attached no importance
to the question whether the members were members of the
Party or not. Ninety percent of the members of the Academy of
German Law were not members of the Party. Their task was to
prepare laws, and they worked somewhat on the lines of an advisory
committee in a well-organized parliament. It was also my idea that
the advisory committees of the Academy should replace the legal
committees of the German Reichstag, which was gradually fading
into the background in the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the main the Academy helped to frame only laws of an
economic or social nature, since owing to the development of the
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
totalitarian regime it became more and more impossible to co-operate
in other spheres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: If I understand you correctly, then the governmental
administration of law was solely in the hands of the Reich Minister
of Justice, and that was not you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No, I was not Reich Minister of Justice. The Reich
Minister of Justice, Dr. Gürtner, was, however, not competent for
the entire field of legislation but merely for those laws which came
within the scope of his ministry. Legislation in the Reich, in accordance
with the Enabling Act, was in the hands of the Führer and
Reich Chancellor and the Reich Government as a body. Consequently
my name appears in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> at the bottom of one law
only, and that is the law regarding the Reintroduction of Compulsory
Military Service. However, I am proud that my name stands at the
end of that law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You have stated earlier that during 1933 and 1934
you were Bavarian Minister of Justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In that capacity did you have an opportunity of
voicing your opinion on the question of concentration camps, and
what were the circumstances?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I learned that the Dachau concentration camp was being
established in connection with a report which came to me from the
Senior Public Prosecutor’s Office in Munich on the occasion of the
killing of the Munich attorney, Dr. Strauss. This Public Prosecutor’s
Office complained to me, after I had given them orders to investigate
the killing, that the SS had refused them admission to the Dachau
concentration camp. Thereupon I had Reich Governor, General
Von Epp, call a meeting where I produced the files regarding this
killing and pointed out the illegality of such an action on the part of
the SS and stated that so far representatives from the German Public
Prosecutor’s Office had always been able to investigate any death
which evoked a suspicion that a crime had been committed and that
I had not become aware so far of any departure from this principle
in the Reich. After that I continued protesting against this method
to Dr. Gürtner, the Reich Minister of Justice and at the same time
Attorney General. I pointed out that this meant the beginning of a
development which threatened the legal system in an alarming
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Heinrich Himmler’s request Adolf Hitler intervened personally
in this matter, and he used his power to quash any legal proceedings.
The proceedings were ordered to be quashed. I handed in
my resignation as Minister of Justice, but it was not accepted.
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: When did you become Governor General of the
occupied Polish territories, and where were you when you were
informed of this appointment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: On 24 August 1939, as an officer in the reserve, I had
to join my regiment in Potsdam. I was busy training my company;
and on 17 September, or it may have been 16, I was making my
final preparations before going to the front when a telephone call
came from the Führer’s special train ordering me to go to the Führer
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following day I traveled to Upper Silesia where the Führer’s
special train was stationed at that time; and in a very short conversation,
which lasted less than ten minutes, he gave me the mission,
as he put it, to take over the functions of Civil Governor for the
occupied Polish territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time the whole of the conquered Polish territories was
under the administrative supreme command of a military commander,
General Von Rundstedt. Toward the end of September I
was attached to General Von Rundstedt’s staff as Chief of Administration,
and my task was to do the administrative work in the
Military Government. In a short time, however, it was found that
this method did not work; and when the Polish territories were
divided into the part which was incorporated into the German Reich
and the part which then became the Government General, I was
appointed Governor General as from 26 October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You have mentioned the various positions which you
held over a number of years. I now ask you: Did you, in any of
the positions you held in the Party or the State, play any vital part
in the political events of the last 20 years?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In my own sphere I did everything that could possibly
be expected of a man who believes in the greatness of his people
and who is filled with fanaticism for the greatness of his country,
in order to bring about the victory of Adolf Hitler and the National
Socialist movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never participated in far-reaching political decisions, since I
never belonged to the circle of the closest associates of Adolf Hitler,
neither was I consulted by Adolf Hitler on general political questions,
nor did I ever take part in conferences about such problems.
Proof of this is that throughout the period from 1933 to 1945 I was
received only six times by Adolf Hitler personally, to report to him
about my sphere of activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What share did you have in the legislation of the
Reich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I have already told you that, and there is no need to
give a further answer.
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you, as a Reich Minister or in any other State
or Party post want this war, or did you desire a war in violation
of treaties entered into?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: War is not a thing one wants. War is terrible. We
have lived through it; we did not want the war. We wanted a great
Germany and the restoration of the freedom and welfare, the health
and happiness of our people. It was my dream, and probably the
dream of every one of us, to bring about a revision of the Versailles
Treaty by peaceful means, which was provided for in that very
treaty. But as in the world of treaties, between nations also, it is
only the one who is strong who is listened to; Germany had to
become strong first before we could negotiate. This is how I saw the
development as a whole: the strengthening of the Reich, reinstatement
of its sovereignty in all spheres, and by these means to free
ourselves of the intolerable shackles which had been imposed upon
our people. I was happy, therefore, when Adolf Hitler, in a most
wonderful rise to power, unparalleled in the history of mankind,
succeeded by the end of 1938 in achieving most of these aims; and
I was equally unhappy when in 1939, to my dismay, I realized more
and more that Adolf Hitler appeared to be departing from that
course and to be following other methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This seems to have been covered by what the
Defendant Göring told us, by what the Defendant Ribbentrop told us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The witness has already completed his statement on
this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, what was your share in the events of Poland after 1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I bear the responsibility; and when, on 30 April 1945,
Adolf Hitler ended his life, I resolved to reveal that responsibility
of mine to the world as clearly as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not destroy the 43 volumes of my diary, which report on
all these events and the share I had in them; but of my own accord
I handed them voluntarily to the officers of the American Army
who arrested me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, do you feel guilty of having committed
crimes in violation of international conventions or crimes against
humanity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is a question that the Tribunal has got
to decide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I shall drop the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, what do you have to say regarding the accusations
which have been brought against you in the Indictment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: To these accusations I can only say that I ask the
Tribunal to decide upon the degree of my guilt at the end of
my case.
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself, speaking from the very depths of my feelings and
having lived through the 5 months of this trial, want to say that
now after I have gained a full insight into all the horrible atrocities
which have been committed, I am possessed by a deep sense of guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What were your aims when you took over the post
of Governor General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was not informed about anything. I heard about
special action commandos of the SS here during this trial. In connection
with and immediately following my appointment, special
powers were given to Himmler, and my competence in many
essential matters was taken away from me. A number of Reich
offices governed directly in matters of economy, social policy,
currency policy, food policy, and therefore, all I could do was to lay
upon myself the task of seeing to it that amid the conflagration of
this war, some sort of an order should be built up which would
enable men to live. The work I did out there, therefore, cannot be
judged in the light of the moment, but must be judged in its entirety,
and we shall have to come to that later. My aim was to safeguard
justice, without doing harm to our war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, did the police, and particularly the Security
Police and SD, come under your jurisdiction in the Government
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The Higher SS and Police Leaders were in principle
subordinate to the Reichsführer SS Himmler. The SS did not come
under my command, and any orders or instructions which I might
have given would not have been obeyed. Witness Bühler will cover
this question in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general arrangement was that the Higher SS and Police
Leader was formally attached to my office, but in fact, and by
reason of his activities, he was purely an agent of the Reichsführer
SS Himmler. This state of affairs, even as early as November 1939,
was the cause of my first offer to resign which I made to Adolf
Hitler. It was a state of affairs which made things extremely difficult
as time went by. In spite of all my attempts to gain control
of these matters, the drift continued. An administration without a
police executive is powerless and there were many proofs of this.
The police officers, so far as discipline, organization, pay, and orders
were concerned, came exclusively under the German Reich police
system and were in no way connected with the administration of
the Government General. The officials of the SS and Police therefore
did not consider that they were attached to the Government
General in matters concerning their duty, neither was the police
area called “Police Area, Government General.” Moreover the
Higher SS and Police Leader did not call himself “SS and Police
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
Leader in the Government General” but “Higher SS and Police
Leader East.” However, I do not propose to go into details at this
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, did the concentration camps in the Government
General come under you, and did you have anything to do
with their administration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Concentration camps were entirely a matter for the
police and had nothing to do with the administration. Members of
the civil administration were officially prohibited from entering the
camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Have you yourself ever been in a concentration
camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In 1935 I participated in a visit to the Dachau concentration
camp, which had been organized for the Gauleiters. That
was the only time that I have entered a concentration camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, in 1942, by a decree of the Führer, a State
Secretariat for Security in the Government General was created.
The date is 7 May 1942. What was the reason for creating that State
Secretariat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The establishment of this State Secretariat was one of
the many attempts to solve the problem of the police in the Government
General. I was very happy about it at the time, because I
thought now we had found the way to solve the problem. I am
certain it would have worked if Himmler and Krüger had adhered
to the principle of this decree, which was co-operation and not
working against each other. But before long it transpired that this
renewed attempt, too, was merely camouflage; and the old conditions
continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: On 3 June 1942, on the basis of this Führer decree,
another decree was issued regarding the transfer of official business
to the State Secretary for Security. Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I assume so, if you have the document. I cannot
remember the details of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In that case I shall ask the witness Bilfinger about
this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: But I should like to add something to that. Wherever
the SS is discussed here, the SS and the police are considered as
forming one body. It would not be right of me if I did not correct
that wrong conception. I have known during the course of these
years so many honest, clean, and upright soldiers among the SS,
and especially among the Waffen-SS and the police, that when
judging here the problem of the SS in regard to the criminal nature
of their activities, one can draw the same clear distinction as in the
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
case of any of the other social groups. The SS, as such, behaved no
more criminally than any other social groups would behave when
taking part in political events. The dreadful thing was that the
responsible chief, and a number of other SS men who unfortunately
had been given considerable powers, were able to abuse the loyal
attitude which is so typical of the German soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, another question. In the decree concerning
the creation of the State Secretariat for Security, it is ordered that
the State Secretary—which in this case was the Higher SS and Police
Leader—before making basic decisions, had to ask you for your
approval. Was that done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No, I was never called upon to give my approval and
that was the reason why before long this, my last, attempt proved
to be a failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did the Higher SS and Police Leader and the SS
Obergruppenführer Krüger, in particular, obey orders which you
had given them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Please, would you repeat the question? It did not come
through too well. And please, Dr. Seidl, do not speak quite so loudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did the Higher SS and Police Leader Krüger, who
at the same time was the State Secretary for Security, obey orders
which you gave him in your capacity as Governor General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Not even a single order. On the strength of this new
decree I repeatedly gave orders. These orders were supposedly
communicated to Heinrich Himmler; and as his agreement was
necessary, these orders were never carried out. Some special cases
can be confirmed by the State Secretary Bühler when he is here
as a witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did the Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German
Police, before he carried out security police measures in the Government
General, ever obtain your approval?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Not in a single case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution has submitted a document, L-37, as
Exhibit Number USA-506. It is a letter from the Commander of
the Security Police and SD of the District Radom, addressed to the
branch office at Tomassov. This document contains the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On 28 June 1944 the Higher SS and Police Leader East issued
the following order:</p>

<p>“The security situation in the Government General has deteriorated
so much during the recent months that the most
radical means and the most severe measures must now be
employed against these alien assassins and saboteurs. The
Reichsführer SS in agreement with the Governor General, has
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
given order that in every case of assassination or attempted
assassination of Germans, not only the perpetrators shall be
shot when caught, but that in addition, all their male relatives
shall also be executed, and their female relatives above the
age of sixteen put into a concentration camp.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: As I have said that I was never called upon by the
Reichsführer SS Himmler to give my approval to such orders, your
question has already been answered. In this case, I was not called
upon either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, were you at least informed of such orders
from the Reichsführer SS Himmler or from the Higher SS and
Police Leader East before they were carried out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The reason why this was not done was always the same.
I was told that as Poles were living not only in the Government
General but also in those territories which had been incorporated
into the Reich, the fight against the Polish resistance movement had
to be carried on by unified control from a central office, and this
central office was Heinrich Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, what jurisdiction did you have in the
general administration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I think it would accelerate the proceedings if the
Witness Bühler could testify to these details. If the Tribunal so
desires I will of course answer this question now. In the main I
was concerned with the setting up of the usual administrative
departments, such as food, culture, finance, science, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Were there representatives of the Polish and Ukrainian
population in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes. The representation of the Polish and Ukrainian
population was on a regional basis, and I united the heads of the bodies
of representatives from the various districts in the so-called subsidiary
committees. There was a Polish and an Ukrainian subsidiary
committee. Count Ronikier was the head of the Polish committee
for a number of years, and at the head of the Ukrainian committee
was Professor Kubiowicz. I made it obligatory for all my offices to
contact these subsidiary committees on all questions of a general
nature, and this they did. I myself was in constant contact with both
of them. Complaints were brought to me there and we had free discussions.
My complaints and memoranda to the Führer were mostly
based on the reports from these subsidiary committees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second form in which the population participated in the
administration of the Government General was by means of the
lowest administrative units, which throughout the Government
General were in the hands of the native population. Every ten to
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
twenty villages had as their head a so-called <span class='it'>Wojt</span>. This Polish
word <span class='it'>Wojt</span> is the same as the German word “Vogt”—V-o-g-t. He
was, so to speak, the lowest administrative unit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A third form of participation by the population in the administration
was the employment of about 280,000 Poles and Ukrainians
as government officials or civil servants in the public services of the
Government General, including the postal and railway services.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In what numerical proportion did the German civil
servants stand to the Polish and Ukrainian civil servants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The proportion varied. The number of German civil
servants was very small. There were times when, in the whole of
the Government General, the area of which is 150,000 square kilometers—that
means half the size of Italy—there were not more than
40,000 German civil servants. That means to one German civil
servant there were on the average at least six non-German civil
servants and employees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Which territories did you rule as Governor General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Poland, which had been jointly conquered by Germany
and the Soviet Union, was divided first of all between the Soviet
Union and the German Reich. Of the 380,000 square kilometers,
which is the approximate size of the Polish State, approximately
200,000 square kilometers went to the Soviet Union and approximately
170,000 to 180,000 square kilometers to the German Reich.
Please do not ask me for exact figures; that was roughly the proportion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That part of Poland which was taken over into Soviet Russian
territory was immediately treated as an integral part of the Soviet
Union. The border signs in the east of the Government General
were the usual Reich border signs of the Soviet Union, as from
1939. That part which came to Germany was divided thus: 90,000
square kilometers were left to the Government General and the
remainder was incorporated into the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think there is any charge against the
defendant on the ground that the civil administration was bad. The
charge is that crimes were committed, and the details of the administration
between the Government General and the department in
the Reich are not really in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The only reason, Mr. President, why I put that question
was to demonstrate the difficulties with which the administration
had to cope right from the beginning in this territory, for an area
which originally represented one economic unit was now split into
three different parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I am coming now to the next question.
Did you ever have hostages shot?
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: My diary contains the facts. I myself have never had
hostages shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you ever participate in the annihilation of Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I say “yes”; and the reason why I say “yes” is because,
having lived through the 5 months of this trial, and particularly
after having heard the testimony of the witness Hoess, my conscience
does not allow me to throw the responsibility solely on these minor
people. I myself have never installed an extermination camp for
Jews, or promoted the existence of such camps; but if Adolf Hitler
personally has laid that dreadful responsibility on his people, then
it is mine too, for we have fought against Jewry for years; and we
have indulged in the most horrible utterances—my own diary bears
witness against me. Therefore, it is no more than my duty to answer
your question in this connection with “yes.” A thousand years will
pass and still this guilt of Germany will not have been erased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, what was your policy for the recruiting of
laborers for the Reich when you were Governor General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What policy did you pursue for the recruiting of
labor for the Reich in your capacity as Governor General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The policy is laid down in my decrees. No doubt they
will be held against me by the Prosecution, and I consider it will
save time if I answer that question later, with the permission of the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, did Hitler give you any instructions as to
how you should carry out your administration as Governor General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: During the first 10 minutes of the audience in his special
train Adolf Hitler instructed me to see to it that this territory, which
had been utterly devastated—all the bridges had been blown up; the
railways no longer functioned, and the population was in a complete
turmoil—was put into order somehow; and that I should see to it
that this territory should become a factor which would contribute to
the improvement of the terribly difficult economic and war situation
of the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did Adolf Hitler support you in your work as Governor
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: All my complaints, everything I reported to him, were
unfortunately dropped into the wastepaper basket by him. I did
not send in my resignation 14 times for nothing. It was not for
nothing that I tried to join my brave troops as an officer. In his
heart he was always opposed to lawyers, and that was one of the
most serious shortcomings of this outstandingly great man. He did
not want to admit formal responsibility, and that, unfortunately,
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
applied to his policy too, as I have found out now. Every lawyer
to him was a disturbing element working against his power. All I
can say, therefore, is that, by supporting Himmler’s and Bormann’s
aims to the utmost, he permanently jeopardized any attempt to find
a form of government worthy of the German name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Which departments of the Reich gave instructions
to you regarding the administration of the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In order to expedite the proceedings I should like to
suggest that the witness Bühler give the whole list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you ever loot art treasures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: An accusation which is one that touches my private life,
and affects me most deeply, is that I am supposed to have enriched
myself with the art treasures of the country entrusted to me. I did
not collect pictures and I did not find time during the war to appropriate
art treasures. I took care to see that all the art treasures of
the country entrusted to me were officially registered, and had that
official register incorporated in a document which was widely distributed;
and, above all, I saw to it that those art treasures remained
in the country right to the very end. In spite of that, art treasures
were removed from the Government General. A part was taken
away before my administration was established. Experience shows
that one cannot talk of responsibility for an administration until
some time after it has been functioning, namely, when the administration
has been built up from the bottom. So that from the
outbreak of the war, 1 September 1939, until this point, which was
about at the end of 1939, I am sure that art treasures were stolen
to an immeasurable extent either as war booty or under some other
pretext. During the registration of the art treasures, Adolf Hitler
gave the order that the Veit Stoss altar should be removed from
St. Mary’s Church in Kraków, and taken to the Reich. In September
1939 Mayor Liebel came from Nuremberg to Kraków for that purpose
with a group of SS men and removed this altar. A third instance
was the removal of the Dürer etchings in Lvov by a special deputy
before my administration was established there. In 1944, shortly
before the collapse, art treasures were removed to the Reich for
storage. In the Castle of Seichau, in Silesia, there was a collection
of art treasures which had been brought there by Professor Kneisl
for this purpose. One last group of art treasures was handed over
to the Americans by me personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, did you introduce ghettos, that is, Jewish
quarters in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I issued an instruction regarding the setting up of
Jewish quarters. I do not remember the date. As to the reasons
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
and the necessity for that, I shall have to answer the Prosecutor’s
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you introduce badges to mark the Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you yourself introduce forced labor in the
Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Forced labor and compulsory labor service were introduced
by me in one of the first decrees; but it is quite clear from
all the decrees and their wording that I had in mind only a labor
service within the country for repairing the damage caused by the
war, and for carrying out work necessary for the country itself, as
was of course done by the labor service in the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you, as was stated by the Prosecution, plunder
libraries in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I can answer that question plainly with “no.” The
largest and most valuable library which we found, the Jagellon
University Library in Kraków, which thank God was not destroyed,
was transferred to a new library building on my own personal
orders; and the entire collection, including the most ancient documents,
was looked after with great care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, did you as Governor General close down
the universities in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The universities in the Government General were closed
because of the war when we arrived. The reopening of the universities
was prohibited by order of Adolf Hitler. I supplied the needs
of the Polish and Ukrainian population by introducing university
courses of instruction for Polish and Ukrainian students—which
were actually on a university level—in such a way that the Reich
Authorities could not criticize it. The fact that there was an urgent
need for native university-trained men, particularly doctors, technicians,
lawyers, teachers, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, was the best guarantee that the
Poles and Ukrainians would be allowed to continue university
teaching to the extent which war conditions would allow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, we were last speaking of the universities.
Did you yourself, as Governor General, close the secondary schools?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: My suggestion to reopen the Gymnasiums and secondary
schools was rejected by Adolf Hitler. We helped to solve the problem
by permitting secondary school education in a large number of
private schools.
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Now, a basic question. The Prosecution accuse you
of having plundered the country ruled by you as Governor General.
What do you have to say to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Well, evidently by that accusation is meant everything
that happened in the economic sphere in that country as a result of
the arrangements between the German Reich and the Government
General. First, I would like to emphasize that the Government
General had to start with a balance sheet which revealed a frightful
economic situation. The country had approximately twelve million
inhabitants. The area of the Government General was the least
fertile part of the former Poland. Moreover, the boundary between
the Soviet Union, as well as the boundary between the German
Reich, had been drawn in such a way that the most essential
elements, indispensable for economy, were left outside. The frontiers
between the Soviet Union and the German Reich were immediately
closed; and so, right from the start, we had to make something out
of nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Galicia, the most important area in the Republic of Poland from
the viewpoint of food supplies, was given to the Soviet Union. The
province of Posen belonged to the German Reich. The coal and
industrial areas of Upper Silesia were within the German Reich.
The frontier with Germany was drawn in such a way that the iron
works in Czestochowa remained with the Government General,
whereas the iron-ore basins which were 10 kilometers from Czestochowa
were incorporated into the German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town of Lodz, the textile center of Poland, came within the
German Reich. The city of Warsaw with a population of several
millions became a frontier town because the German border came
as close as 15 kilometers to Warsaw, and the result was that the
entire agricultural hinterland was no longer at the disposal of that
city. A great many facts could be mentioned, but that would probably
take us too far. The first thing we had to do was to set things
going again somehow. During the first weeks the population of
Warsaw could only be fed with the aid of German equipment for
mass feeding. The German Reich at that time sent 600,000 tons of
grain, as a loan of course, and that created a heavy debt for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started the financial economy with 20 million zlotys which had
been advanced to me by the Reich. We started with a completely
impoverished economy due to the devastation caused by the war,
and by the first of January 1944 the savings bank accounts of the
native population had reached the amount of 11,500 million zlotys,
and we had succeeded by then in improving the feeding of the
population to a certain extent. Furthermore, at that time the factories
and industrial centers had been reconstructed, to which
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
reconstruction the Reich authorities had made outstanding contributions;
Reich Marshal Göring and Minister Speer especially
deserve great credit for the help given in reviving the industry
of the country. More than two million fully paid workers were
employed; the harvest had increased to 1.6 million tons in a year;
the yearly budget had increased from 20 million zlotys in the year
1939 to 1,700 million zlotys. All this is only a sketch which I submit
here to describe the general development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, in your capacity as Governor General did
you persecute churches and religion in the areas which you had
under your administration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was in constant personal contact with the Archbishop,
now Cardinal, Sapieha in Kraków. He told me of all his sufferings
and worries, and they were not few. I myself had to rescue the
Bishop of Lublin from the hands of Herr Globocznik in order to save
his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You mean the SS Gruppenführer Globocznik?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, that is the one I mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I may summarize the situation by quoting the letter which
Archbishop Sapieha sent to me in 1942, in which, to use his own
words, he thanked me for my tireless efforts to protect the life of
the church. We reconstructed seminaries for priests; and we investigated
every case of arrest of a priest, as far as that was humanly
possible. The tragic incident when two assistants of the Archbishop
Sapieha were shot, which has been mentioned here by the Prosecution,
stirred my own emotions very deeply. I cannot say any
more. The churches were open; the seminaries were educating
priests; the priests were in no way prevented from carrying out
their functions. The monastery at Czestochowa was under my personal
protection. The Kraków monastery of the Camaldulians, which
is a religious order, was also under my personal protection. There
were large posters around the monastery indicating that these
monasteries were protected by me personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, when did you hear for the first time about
the concentration camp at Maidanek?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I heard the name Maidanek for the first time in 1944
from foreign reports. But for years there had been contradictory
rumors about the camp near Lublin, or in the Lublin District, if I
may express myself in such a general way. Governor Zörner once
told me, I believe already in 1941, that the SS intended to build a
large concentration camp near Lublin and had applied for large
quantities of building materials, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. At that time I instructed
State Secretary Bühler to investigate the matter immediately, and
I was told, and I also received a report in writing from Reichsführer
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
SS Himmler, that he had to build a large camp required by the
Waffen-SS to manufacture clothes, footwear, and underwear in large
SS-owned workshops. This camp went under the name of “SS
Works,” or something similar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I have to say I was in a position to get information, whereas
the witnesses who have testified so far have said under oath that
in the circles around the Führer nothing was known about all these
things. We out there were more independent, and I heard quite a
lot through enemy broadcasts and enemy and neutral papers. In
answer to my repeated questions as to what happened to the Jews
who were deported, I was always told they were to be sent to the
East, to be assembled, and put to work there. But, the stench seemed
to penetrate the walls, and therefore I persisted in my investigations
as to what was going on. Once a report came to me that there was
something going on near Belcec. I went to Belcec the next day.
Globocznik showed me an enormous ditch which he was having
made as a protective wall and on which many thousands of workers,
apparently Jews, were engaged. I spoke to some of them, asked
them where they came from, how long they had been there, and he
told me, that is, Globocznik, “They are working here now, and when
they are through—they come from the Reich, or somewhere from
France—they will be sent further east.” I did not make any further
inquiries in that same area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rumor, however, that the Jews were being killed in the
manner which is now known to the entire world would not be
silenced. When I expressed the wish to visit the SS workshop near
Lublin, in order to get some idea of the value of the work that was
being done, I was told that special permission from Heinrich Himmler
was required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked Heinrich Himmler for this special permission. He said
that he would urge me not to go to the camp. Again some time
passed. On 7 February 1944 I succeeded in being received by Adolf
Hitler personally—I might add that throughout the war he received
me three times only. In the presence of Bormann I put the question
to him: “My Führer, rumors about the extermination of the Jews
will not be silenced. They are heard everywhere. No one is allowed
in anywhere. Once I paid a surprise visit to Auschwitz in order to
see the camp, but I was told that there was an epidemic in the camp
and my car was diverted before I got there. Tell me, My Führer, is
there anything in it?” The Führer said, “You can very well imagine
that there are executions going on—of insurgents. Apart from that
I do not know anything. Why don’t you speak to Heinrich Himmler
about it?” And I said, “Well, Himmler made a speech to us in
Kraków and declared in front of all the people whom I had officially
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
called to the meeting that these rumors about the systematic extermination
of the Jews were false; the Jews were merely being brought
to the East.” Thereupon the Führer said, “Then you must believe
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in 1944 I got the first details from the foreign press about
the things which were going on, my first question was to the SS
Obergruppenführer Koppe, who had replaced Krüger. “Now we
know,” I said, “you cannot deny that.” And he said that nothing
was known to him about these things, and that apparently it
was a matter directly between Heinrich Himmler and the camp
authorities. “But,” I said, “already in 1941 I heard of such plans,
and I spoke about them.” Then he said that was my business and
he could not worry about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maidanek Camp must have been run solely by the SS, in the
way I have mentioned, and apparently, in the same manner as
stated by the witness Hoess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the only explanation that I can give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Therefore you did not know of the conditions in
Treblinka, Auschwitz, and other camps? Did Treblinka belong to
Maidanek, or is that a separate camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I do not know; it seems to be a separate camp. Auschwitz
was not in the area of the Government General. I was never
in Maidanek, nor in Treblinka, nor in Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the Prosecution has presented under Number
USA-275 the report of the SS Brigadeführer Stroop on the destruction
of the Warsaw Ghetto. Before that action was initiated, did you
know anything about it and did you ever come across this report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was surprised when the American Chief Prosecutor
said in his opening speech, while submitting a document here with
pictures about the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, that that
report had been made to me. But that has been clarified in the
meantime. The report was never made for me, and was never sent
to me in that form. And, thank Heaven, during the last few days
it has been made clear by several witnesses and affidavits that this
destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto was carried out upon direct orders
of Himmler, and over the head of all competent authorities of the
Government General. When in our meetings anybody spoke about
this Ghetto, it was always said that there had been a revolt in the
Warsaw Ghetto which we had had to quell with artillery; reports
that were made on it never seemed to me to be authentic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What measures did you take to see that the
population in the Government General was fed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: An abundance of measures were taken to get agriculture
going again, to import machinery, to teach farmers improved farming
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
methods, to build up co-operative associations, to distribute seeds in
the usual way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Witness Bühler will speak about that later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Moreover the Reich helped a great deal in that respect.
The Reich sent seeds to the value of many millions of marks, agricultural
experts, breeding cattle, machines, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, you have told us what you did for the
welfare of the population of the Government General. The Prosecution,
however, has charged you with a number of statements which
they found in your own diary, and which seem to contradict that.
How can you explain that contradiction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: One has to take the diary as a whole. You can not go
through 43 volumes and pick out single sentences and separate them
from their context. I would like to say here that I do not want to
argue or quibble about individual phrases. It was a wild and stormy
period filled with terrible passions, and when a whole country is on
fire and a life and death struggle is going on, such words may easily
be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Some of the words are terrible. I myself must admit
that I was shocked at many of the words which I had used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, under Number USA-297 the Prosecution
has submitted a document which deals with a conference which you
apparently had in 1939 or 1940 with an office of the Chief of the
Administration Ober-Ost. I shall have the document handed to you
and ask you to tell me whether the report of that man, as it is
contained in the document, agrees with what you have said. It is on
Page 1, at the bottom, the second paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That is a shortened summary of a speech, which perhaps
in an address...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the PS number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Dr. Frank, what is the number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: 297, I believe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: No, on the cover, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: On the cover it says 344. I will return the document to
you. Would you kindly ask me about individual phrases. It is impossible
for me to read all of its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The number is 297, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, it is USA-297. It is EC-344, (16) and
(17), is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] It says here that during the first conversation
which the chief of the central department had with the
Reich Minister Dr. Frank on 3 October 1939 in Posen, the latter
explained the task which had been given him by the Führer and
the economic-political principles on which he intended to base his
administration of Poland. This could only be done by ruthless exploitation
of the country. Therefore, it would be necessary to
recruit manpower to be used in the Reich, and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have summarized it, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I am sure that these utterances were not made in the
way it is put here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: But you do not want to say that you have never
spoken to that man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I cannot remember it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then, I come to the next question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Moreover, what actually happened seems to me to be
more important than what was said at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that your actions as Governor General,
and undoubtedly also many excesses by the police and the SD, were
due to the guerrilla activities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Guerrilla activities? It can be said that it was the resistance
movement, which started from the very first day and was
supported by our enemies, which presented the most difficult problem
I had to cope with during all these years. For this resistance movement
perpetually supplied the police and the SS with pretexts and
excuses for all those measures which, from the viewpoint of an
orderly administration, were very regrettable. In fact, the resistance
movement—I will not call it guerrilla activity, because if a people
has been conquered during a war and organizes an active resistance
movement, that is something definitely to be respected—but the
methods of the resistance movement went far beyond the limits of
an heroic revolt. German women and children were slaughtered
under the most atrocious circumstances. German officials were shot;
trains were derailed; dairies were destroyed; and all measures taken
to bring about the recovery of the country were systematically
undermined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it is against the background of these incidents, which occurred
day after day, incessantly, during practically the entire period
of my activity, that the events in that country must be considered.
That is all I have to say to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, in the year 1944 a revolt broke out in
Warsaw under the leadership of General Bor. What part did the
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
administration of the Government General have, and what part did
you have in putting down that revolt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That revolt broke out, when the Soviet Russian Army
had advanced to within about 30 kilometers of Warsaw on the
eastern bank of the Vistula. It was a sort of combined operation;
and, as it seems to me, also a national Polish action, as the Poles at
the last moment wanted to carry out the liberation of their capital
themselves and did not want to owe it to the Soviet Russians. They
probably were thinking of how, in Paris, at the last moment the
resistance movement, even before the Allies had approached, had
accomplished the liberation of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The operation was a strictly military one. As Senior Commander
of the German troops used to quell the revolt, I believe, they
appointed SS General Von dem Bach-Zelewski. The civil administration,
therefore, did not have any part in the fighting. The part
played by the civil administration began only after the capitulation
of General Bor, when the most atrocious orders for vengeance came
from the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter came to my desk one day in which Hitler demanded the
deportation of the entire population of Warsaw into German concentration
camps. It took a struggle of 3 weeks, from which I emerged
victorious, to avert that act of insanity and to succeed in having the
fleeing population of Warsaw, which had had no part in the revolt,
distributed throughout the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During that revolt, unfortunately, the city of Warsaw was very
seriously damaged. All that had taken years to rebuild was burned
down in a few weeks. However, State Secretary Bühler, in order
to save time, will probably be in a better position to give us more
details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, you are also accused of having suppressed
the cultural life of the population of the Government General,
especially as regards the theater, broadcasting, films. What have
you to say about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The Government General presented the same picture
as every occupied country. We do not have to look far from this
courtroom to see what cultural life is like in an occupied country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had broadcasting in the Polish language under German supervision.
We had a Polish press which was supervised by Germans,
and we had a Polish school system, that is, elementary schools and
high schools, in which at the end, 80,000 teachers taught in the
service of the Government General. As far as it was possible Polish
theaters were reopened in the large cities, and where German
theaters were established we made sure that there was also a Polish
theater at the same time. After the proclamation of the so-called
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
total war in August 1944, the absurd situation arose in which the
German theater in Kraków was closed, because all German theaters
were closed at that time, whereas the Polish theaters remained open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself selected composers and virtuosos from a group of the
most well known musicians of Poland I found there in 1939 and
founded the Philharmonic Orchestra of the Government General.
This was in being until the end, and played an important part in
the cultural life of Poland. I established a Chopin Museum in
Kraków, and from all over Europe I collected relics of Chopin. I
believe that is sufficient on this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, you deny, therefore, having taken any
measures which aimed at exterminating Polish and Ukrainian
culture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Culture cannot be exterminated. Any measures taken
with that intention would be sheer nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that as far as it was in your power you
did everything to avoid epidemics and to improve the health of the
population?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That State Secretary Bühler will be able to confirm in
detail. I can say that everything humanly possible was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the Prosecution, under Number USSR-223,
has submitted an excerpt from the diary, which deals with the
report about a police conference of 30 May 1940, and we find here
in Pages 33 to 38 the following...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] Unless the Court orders it, it is not necessary
to read that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: No, I only want to read one sentence, which refers
to the Kraków professors. Apparently, if the diary is correct, you
said...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] May I say something about the Kraków
professors right away?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: On 7 November 1939 I came to Kraków. On 5 November
1939 before my arrival, the SS and the police, as I found out
later, called the Kraków professors to a meeting. They thereupon
arrested the men, among them dignified old professors, and took
them to some concentration camp. I believe it was Oranienburg. I
found that report when I arrived and against everything which
may be found there in my diary, I want to emphasize here under
oath that I did not cease in my attempts to get every one of the
professors released whom I could reach, in March 1940. That is all
I have to say to this.
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The same police meeting of 30 May 1940 also dealt
with the so-called “AB Action,” that is, with the Extraordinary
Pacification Action. Before I put to you the question which is concerned
with it, I would like to read to you two entries in the diary.
One is dated 16 May 1940, and here, after describing that extraordinary
tension then existing, you stated the following: That, first
of all, an action for pacification would have to be started, and then
you said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Any arbitrary actions must be avoided; in all cases the safeguarding
of the authority of the Führer and of the Reich has
to be kept in the foreground.”—I omit several sentences and
quote the end—“The action is timed for 15 June.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 12 July a conference took place with the Ministerialrat Wille,
who was the chief of the Department of Justice, and there you said
in your own words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Regarding the question as to what should happen to the
political criminals who had been arrested during the AB
Action, there is to be a conference with State Secretary
Bühler, Obergruppenführer Krüger, Brigadeführer Streckenbach
and Ministerialrat Wille.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>End of quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What actually happened during that AB Action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I cannot say any more or any less than what is contained
in the diary. The situation was extremely tense. Month after
month attempted assassinations increased. The encouragement and
support given by the rest of the world to the resistance movement
to undermine all our efforts to pacify the country had succeeded to
an alarming degree, and this led to this general pacification action,
not only in the Government General, but also in other areas, and
which I believe was ordered by the Führer himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My efforts were directed to limiting it as to extent and method,
and in this I was successful. Moreover I should like to point out
that I also made it clear that I intended to exercise the right of
reprieve in each individual case; for that purpose I wanted the
police and SS verdicts of death by shooting to be submitted to a
reprieve committee which I had formed in that connection. I believe
that can be seen from the diary also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Probably the witness Bühler knows something
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Nevertheless, I would like to say that the method used
at that time was a tremendous mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, have you at any time recognized the
principle introduced by the SD and SS of the liability of kin?
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No, on the contrary. When I received the first reports
about it, I complained in writing to Reich Minister Lammers about
that peculiar development of the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The first SS and Police Leader East was Obergruppenführer
Krüger. When was this SS leader recalled and
how did it come about?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The relations between him and myself became quite
impossible. He wanted a peculiar kind of SS and police regime,
and that state of affairs could be solved only in one way—either
he or I had to go. I think that at the last moment, by the intervention
of Kaltenbrunner, if I remember correctly, and of Bach-Zelewski,
this remarkable fellow was removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution once mentioned that it was more
a personal struggle for power. But is it more correct to say that
there were differences of opinion on basic questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Of course it was a struggle for power. I wanted to
establish a power in the sense of my memoranda to the Führer, and
therefore I had to fight the power of violence, and here personal
viewpoints separated altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The successor of SS Obergruppenführer Krüger
was SS Obergruppenführer Koppe. Was his basic attitude different?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes. I had that impression; and I am thinking of him
particularly when I say that even in the SS there were many decent
men who also had a sense of what was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Were there Polish and Ukrainian Police in the
Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, there were 25,000 men of the Polish security,
criminal, and uniformed police, and about 5,000 men of the
Ukrainian police. They also were under the German police chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, I now come to one of the most important
questions. In 1942, in Berlin, Vienna, Heidelberg, and Munich, you
made speeches before large audiences. What was the purpose of
these speeches, and what were the consequences for you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The speeches can be read. It was the last effort that
I made to bring home to Hitler, by means of the tremendous response
of the German people, the truth that the rule of law was immortal.
I stated at that time that a Reich without law and without humanity
could not last long, and more in that vein. After I had been under
police surveillance for several days in Munich, I was relieved of
all my Party offices. As this was a matter of German domestic
politics under the sovereignty of the German Reich, I refrain from
making any more statements about it here.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that after this you tendered your resignation?
And what was the answer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was, so to speak, in a permanent state of resigning,
and I received the same answer: that for reasons connected with
foreign policy I could not be released.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I originally intended to read to you from your
diary a number of quotations which the Prosecution has submitted;
but in view of the fact that the Prosecution may do that in the
course of the cross-examination, I forego it in order to save time.
I have no more questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other member of the defendants’
counsel wish to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CHIEF COUNSELLOR OF JUSTICE L. N. SMIRNOV (Assistant
Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): Defendant, I should like to know what
precisely was your legal status and what exactly was the position
you occupied in the system of the fascist state. Please answer me:
When were you promoted to the post of Governor of occupied
Poland? To whom were you directly subordinated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The date is 26 October 1939. At least on that day the
directive concerning the Governor General became effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You will remember that by
Hitler’s order of 12 October 1939 you were directly subordinated
to Hitler, were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I did not get the first part. What was it, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you remember Hitler’s order
concerning your appointment as Governor General of Poland? This
order was dated 12 October 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That was in no way effective, because the decree came
into force on 26 October 1939, and you can find it in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>.
Before that I was Chief of Administration with the
military commander Von Rundstedt. I have explained that already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: By this order of Hitler you
were directly subordinated to him. Do you remember? Paragraph 3,
Sub-paragraph 1, of this order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The chiefs of administration in the occupied territories
were all immediately under the Führer. I may say in elucidation
that Paragraph 3 states, “The Governor General is immediately
subordinate to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Paragraph 9 of this decree states, “This decree becomes valid
as soon as I have withdrawn from the Commander-in-Chief of the
Army the task of carrying out the military administration.” And
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
this withdrawal, that is, the coming into force of this decree took
place on 26 October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I fully agree with you, and we
have information to that effect in the book which you evidently
remember. It is Book 5. You do remember this book of the
Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: It is of course in the decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Well, when this order came into
force, to whom were you directly subordinate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: What shall I read here? There are several entries here.
What is your wish? To what do you wish me to answer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It states that this order came
into force on the 26 October. Well, when this order actually became
valid, to whom were you subordinated? Was there, or was there
not, any further order issued by Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: There is only one basic decree about the Governor
General. That is this one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Quite correct. There were no
further instructions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Oh yes, there are some, for instance...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I understand that, but there was
no other decree determining the system of administration, was
there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: May I say that you can find it best on Page A-100 in
your book, and there you have the decree of the Führer verbatim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Quite right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: And it says also in Paragraph 9, “This decree shall
come into effect...” and so on, and that date was the 26th of
October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is quite correct. That
means that after 26 October you, as Governor General for occupied
Poland, were directly subordinate to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then perhaps you may remember
when, and by whom, you were entrusted with the execution, in
occupied Poland, of the Four Year Plan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: By Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That means that you were
Göring’s plenipotentiary for the execution of the Four Year Plan
in Poland, were you not?
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The story of that mission is very briefly told. The
activities of several plenipotentiaries of the Four Year Plan in the
Government General were such that I was greatly concerned about
it. Therefore, I approached the Reich Marshal and asked him to
appoint me trustee for the Four Year Plan. That was later—in
January...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, it was in December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, it was later, according to this decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This means that as from the
beginning of December 1939 you were Göring’s plenipotentiary for
the Four Year Plan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Göring’s? I was the plenipotentiary for the Four
Year Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Now perhaps you can remember
that in October 1939 the first decree regarding the organization of
administration in the Government General was promulgated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes. That is here, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps you recall Paragraph 3
of that decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It says that “The sphere of
action of the State Secretary for Security will be determined by
the Governor General in agreement with the Reichsführer SS
and”—this is the passage which interests me—“the Chief of the
German Police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does that not coincide with Paragraph 3 insofar as from the first
day of your appointment as Governor General you undertook the
control of the Police and SS, and, consequently, the responsibility
for their actions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No. I definitely answer that question with “no,” but I
would like to make an explanation....</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What interests me, Defendant;
is how could that be explained otherwise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let him make his explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant, you may make your explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I want to make a very short statement. There is an
old legal principle which says that nobody can transfer more rights
to anybody else than he has himself. What I have stated here was
the ideal which I had before me and how it should have been.
Everybody has to admit that it is natural and logical that the police
should be subordinate to the Chief of Administration. The Führer,
who alone could have decided, did not make that decree. I did
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
not have the power nor the authority to put into effect this decree
which I had so carefully formulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then do I understand you to
say that this Paragraph 3 was an ideal which you strove to attain,
but which you were never able to attain?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I beg your pardon, but I could not understand that
question. A little slower please, and may I have the translation
into German a little slower?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Shall I repeat the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked you a question; does
this mean that the statement can be interpreted as follows: Paragraph
3 of this decree was an ideal which you persistently strove to
attain, which you openly professed, but which you were never able
to attain? Would that be correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Which I could not attain; and that can be seen by
the fact that later it was found necessary to appoint a special
State Secretary for Security in a last effort to find a way out of
the difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps you will recall that in
April 1942, special negotiations took place between you and
Himmler. Did these negotiations take place in April 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes; certainly. I do not know on what you base your
question. I cannot tell you the date offhand, but it was always my
endeavor...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: To confirm these facts, I can
turn to your diary. Perhaps you will recall that as a result of these
negotiations an understanding was reached between you and
Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, an understanding was reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In order to refresh your memory
on the subject I shall ask that the corresponding volume of your
diary be handed to you, so that you may have the text before you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, I am ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would refer you to Paragraph 2
of this agreement. It states:</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where can we find this? Is it under the date
21 April 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes; that is quite right;
21 April 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we have got it.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It is Document Number USSR-223.
It has been translated into English, and I shall hand it over
immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we have it now; we were only trying
to find the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It is on Page 18 of the
English text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would ask you to recall the
contents. It says: “The Higher SS and Police Leader (the State
Secretary) is directly subordinate to the Governor General, and, if
he is absent, then to his Deputy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does this not mean that Himmler, so to speak, agreed with
your ideal in the sense that the Police should be subordinate
to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Certainly. On that day I was satisfied; but a few days
later the whole thing was changed. I can only say that these efforts
on my part were continued, but unfortunately it was never possible
to put them into effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You will find here in Paragraph 3, if you care to go on, that the
Reichsführer SS, according to the expected decree by the Führer,
could give orders to the State Secretary. So, you see, Himmler here
had reserved the right to give orders to Krüger direct. And then
comes the matter of the agreement...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is true, but in that case I
must ask you to refer to another part of the document...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: May I say in this connection that this agreement was
never put into effect, but that this decree was published in the
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> in the form of a Führer decree. Unfortunately, I
do not know the date of that; but you can find the decree about the
regulation of security matters in the Government General, and that
is the only authoritative statement. Here, also, reference is made to
the “expected decree by the Führer,” and that agreement was just a
draft of what was to appear in the Führer decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, I was just proceeding to
that subject. You agree that this decision was practically a verbatim
decree of the Führer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I cannot say that offhand. If you will be good enough
to give me the words of the Führer decree, I will be able to tell you
about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the President.</span>] Incidentally this decree appears in
your document book, Mr. President.
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I haven’t the document. It seems to me that the most
essential parts of that agreement have been taken and put into this
decree, with a few changes. However, the book has been taken
away from me and I cannot compare it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The book will be submitted to you now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The book was submitted to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Very important changes have been made, unfortunately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would request you to turn to
Paragraph 3 of Hitler’s decree, dated 7 May 1942. It is stated here
that the State Secretary for Security is directly subordinate to the
Governor General. And does this not confirm the fact that the police
of the Government General were, nevertheless, directly subordinate
to you? That is Paragraph 3 of the decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I would like to say that that is not so. The police were
not subordinate to me, even by reason of that decree—only the State
Secretary for Security. It does not say here that the police are subordinate
to the Governor General, only the State Secretary for
Security is subordinate to him. If you read Paragraph 4, then you
come to the difficulties again. Adolf Hitler’s decree was drawn up
in my absence, of course. I was not consulted by Hitler, otherwise
1 would have protested, but in any case it was found impracticable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 4 says that the Reichsführer SS and Chief of the
German Police gave direct instructions to the State Secretary for
Security in the field of security and for the preservation of German
nationality. If you compare the original agreement with this, as contained
in the diary, you will find that in one of the most important
fields the Führer had changed his mind, that is, concerning the
Commissioner for the Preservation of German Nationality. This title
embraces the Jewish question and the question of colonization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It appears to me, Defendant,
that you have only taken into consideration one aspect of this question,
and that you have given a rather one-sided interpretation of
the excerpt quoted. May I recall to your memory Paragraph 4 of
this decree which, in Sub-paragraph 2, reads as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The State Secretary”—this means Krüger—“must receive the
consent of the Governor General before carrying out the directives
of the Reichsführer SS and the German Police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now permit me to turn to Paragraph 5 of this self-same
decree of Hitler’s which states that “in cases of divergencies of
opinion between the Governor General and the Reichsführer of the
SS and the German Police, my decision is to be obtained through
the Reich Minister and the Head of the Reich Chancellery.” In this
connection I would ask you, does not this paragraph testify to the
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
very considerable rights granted by you to the leaders of the police
and the SS in the Government General and to your own responsibility
for the activities of these organizations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The wording of the decree testifies to it, but the actual
development was quite the contrary. I believe that we will come to
that in detail. I maintain therefore that this attempt to gain some
influence over the police and the SS also failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then may I ask whose attempt
it was? In this case it is evidently an attempt by Hitler for he signed
this decree. Krüger was evidently more powerful than Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That question is not quite clear to me. You mean that
Krüger went against the decree of the Führer? Of course he did,
but that has nothing to do with power. That was considered by
Himmler as a tremendous concession made to me. I want to refer to
a memorandum of the summer of 1942, I think, shortly after the
decree of the Führer came into force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have the following question to
ask you: Is it possible that you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell us, Defendant, who was the
actual leader of the National Socialist Party in the Government
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I hear nothing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I ask you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I hear nothing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have the following question to
put to you: After 6 May 1940 in the Government General...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: 6 May?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, 6 May 1940, after the Nazi
organization had been completed in the Government General, who
was appointed its leader?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thus the leadership of the administration
of the National Socialist Party and of the Police was
concentrated in your hands. Therefore you are responsible for the
administration, the Police, and the political life of the Government
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Before I answer that question, I must protest when you
say that I had control of the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I believe that that is the only
way one could interpret the Führer’s orders and the other documents
which I have put to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No doubt, if one disregards the actual facts and the
realities of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Well, then, let us pass on to
another group of questions. You heard of the existence of Maidanek
only in 1944, isn’t that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In 1944 the name Maidanek was brought to my knowledge
officially for the first time by the Press Chief Gassner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will now ask that you be
shown a document which was presented by your defense counsel,
which was compiled by you, and which is a report addressed to
Hitler, dated June 1943. I will read into the record one excerpt, and
I wish to remind you that this is dated 19 June 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“As a proof of the mistrust shown to the German leadership,
I enclose a characteristic excerpt from the report of the Chief
of the Security Police and SD in the Government General...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Just a moment. The wrong passage has been shown me.
I have the passage here on Page 35 of the German text, and it is
differently worded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Have you found the place now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes. But you started with a different sentence. The
sentence here starts “A considerable part of the Polish intelligentsia...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which page is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Page 35 of the German text, last
paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: It starts here with the words “A considerable part...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: All right. Then I will continue:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“As a proof of the degree of the mistrust shown to the
German leadership I enclose”—these are your own words,
this passage comes somewhat higher up in the quotation—“a
characteristic excerpt from the report of the Chief of
the Security Police and SD in the Government General for the
period from 1 to 31 May 1943, concerning the possibilities of
propaganda resulting from Katyn.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That is not here. Would you be good enough to show
me the passage? Now, what you are presenting here is not in
my text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, it is there; it comes somewhat
earlier in your text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I think it has been omitted from my text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I begin now at that part which
you find lower down at the bottom. Follow the text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“A large part of the Polish intelligentsia, however, as before,
will not allow itself to be influenced by the news from Katyn
and holds against the Germans alleged similar cruelties,
especially in Auschwitz.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I omit the next sentence and I continue:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Among that portion of the working classes which is not communistically
inclined, this is scarcely denied; at the same time
it is pointed out that the attitude of Germany towards the
Poles is not any better.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Please note the next sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is said that there are concentration camps at Auschwitz
and Maidanek where likewise the mass murder of Poles is
carried out systematically.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>How can one reconcile this part of your report which mentions
Auschwitz and Maidanek, where mass murder took place, with your
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
statement that you heard of Maidanek only at the end of 1944. Well,
your report is dated June 1943; you mentioned there both Maidanek
and Auschwitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: With reference to Maidanek we were talking about the
extermination of Jews. The extermination of Jews in Maidanek
became known to me during the summer of 1944. Up to now the
word “Maidanek” has always been mentioned in connection with
extermination of Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, we are to understand—I
refer to the text submitted to you—that in May 1943 you
heard of the mass murder of Poles in Maidanek, and in 1944 you
heard of the mass murder of Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I beg your pardon? I heard about the extermination of
the Jews at Maidanek in 1944 from the official documents in the
foreign press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you heard of the mass
killings of the Poles in 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That is contained in my memorandum, and I protest:
these are the facts as I put them before the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will ask that another document
be shown to you. Do you know this document, are you acquainted
with it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: It is a decree dated 2 October 1943. I assume that the
wording agrees with the text of the original decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, it is in full agreement with
the original text. In any case your defense counsel can follow the
text and will be able to verify it. I have to ask you one question.
What do you think of this law signed by you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, it is here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You were President of the Reich
Academy of Law. From the standpoint of the most elementary
standards of law, what do you think of this law signed by you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got the number of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It is Exhibit USSR-335, Mr.
President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: This is the general wording for a court-martial decree.
It provides that the proceedings should take place in the presence of
a judge, that a document should be drawn up, and that the proceedings
should be recorded in writing. Apart from that I had the
power to give pardons, so that every sentence had to be submitted
to me.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to tell us how
this court for court-martial proceedings was composed, who the
members of this court were. Would you please pay attention to
Paragraph 3, Point 1 of Paragraph 3?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The Security Police, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You were telling us of your
hostile attitude to the SD. Why then did you give the SD the right
to exert oppression on the Polish population?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Because that was the only way in which I could exert
any influence on the sentences. If I had not published this decree,
there would have been no possibility of control; and the Police
would simply have acted at random.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You spoke of the right of
reprieve which was entrusted to you. Would you please note Paragraph
6 of this law. I remind you that a verdict of a summary court-martial
by the SD was to be put into effect immediately according
to the text. I remind you again that there was only one possible
verdict: “death.” How could you change it if the condemned person
was to be shot or hanged immediately after the verdict?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The sentence would nevertheless have to come before me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, but a sentence had to be
carried out immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Those were the general instructions which I had issued
in connection with the power given me to grant reprieves, and the
committee which dealt with reprieves was constantly sitting. Files
were sent in...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Since you have spoken of the
right to reprieve, I will put to you another question. Do you remember
the AB Action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you remember that this
action signified the execution of thousands of Polish intellectuals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then what did it signify?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: It came within the framework of the general action of
appeasement and it was my plan to eliminate, by means of a properly
regulated procedure, arbitrary actions on the part of the Police.
This was the meaning of that action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I do not understand very well
what you mean. How did you treat persons who were subject to the
AB Action? What happened to them?
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: This meeting really only dealt with the question of
arrests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I ask you what happened to
them later?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: They were arrested and taken into protective custody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Then they were subjected to the proceedings which had
been established. At least, that is what I intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was this left to the Police exclusively?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The Police were in charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In other words, the Police took
over the extermination of these people after they had been arrested,
is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Well, then tell us, please, why
you did not exercise your power of reprieve while they were
carrying out this inhuman action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I did make use of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will put before you your statement,
dated 30 May 1940. You certainly remember this meeting with
the Police on 30 May 1940, when you gave final instructions to the
police before carrying out this action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You stated the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Any attempt on the part of the legal authorities to intervene
in the AB Action, undertaken with the help of the Police,
should be considered as treason to the State and to German
interests.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember this statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I do not remember it, but you must take into account
all the circumstances which spread over several weeks. You must
consider the statement in its entirety and not seize upon one single
sentence. This concerns a development which went on for weeks and
months, in the course of which the reprieve committee was established
by me for the first time. That was my way of protesting
against arbitrary actions and of introducing legal justice in all these
proceedings. That is a development extending over many weeks,
which you cannot, in my opinion, summarize in one sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am speaking of words which
in my opinion can have only one meaning for a jurist. You wrote:
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The reprieve committee which is part of my office is not concerned
with these matters. The AB Action will be carried out
exclusively by Higher SS and Police Leader Krüger and his
organization. This is a purely internal action for quieting
the country which is necessary and lies outside the scope of
a normal legal trial.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is to say you renounced your right of pardon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: At that particular moment; but if you follow the further
development of the AB Action during the following weeks you will
see that this never became effective. That was an intention, a bad
intention, which, thank God, I gave up in time. Perhaps my defense
counsel will be able to say a few words on the subject later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One single question interests me.
Did you renounce your right of pardon while carrying out this
operation or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Well then, how can you account
for your words, this one sentence: “The reprieve committee is not
concerned with these matters.”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>How should we interpret these words?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: This is not a decree; it is not the final ruling on the
matter. It is a remark which was made on the spur of the moment
and was then negotiated on for days. But one must recognize the
final stage of the development, and not merely the various motives
as they came up during the development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, I understand that very well,
Defendant. But I would like to ask you, was this statement made
during a conference with the Police and did you instruct the Police
in that matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Not during that meeting. I assume it came up in some
other connection. Here we discussed only this one action. After all,
I also had to talk to State Secretary Bühler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Well, all right. While discussing
the AB Action with the Police you stated that the results of this
action would not concern the reprieve committee which was subordinated
to you, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That sentence is contained in the diary. It is not, however,
the final result, but rather an intermediate stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps I can recall to you
another sentence, in order that you may judge the results of this
action. Perhaps you can recall this part which I will put to you. You
stated the following:
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We need not bring these elements into German concentration
camps, for in that case we would only have difficulties and an
unnecessary correspondence with their families. We must
simply liquidate matters in the country, and in the simplest
way.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What you mean is that this would simply be a question of
liquidation in the simplest form, is that not so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That is a terrible word. But, thank God, it did not take
place in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, but these persons were executed.
What do you mean by saying that this was not carried out?
Obviously this was carried out, for the persons were executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: When they were sentenced they were killed, if the right
to pardon them was not exercised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And they were condemned without
application of the right of pardon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I do not believe so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Unfortunately these people are
no more, and therefore obviously they were executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Which people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Those who were arrested under
the AB Action. I will remind you of another excerpt connected
with this AB Action. If you did not agree with the Police with
regard to certain police actions it would be difficult to explain the
celebrations in connection with the departure of Brigadeführer SS
Streckenbach when he left for Berlin. Does this not mean that you
were at least on friendly terms with the Police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: In connection with political relations many words of
praise are spoken which are not in keeping with the truth. You
know that as well as any other person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will allow myself to remind
you of only one passage of your speech addressed to the Brigadeführer
Streckenbach, one sentence only. You said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“What you, Brigadeführer Streckenbach, and your people,
have done in the Government General must not be forgotten;
and you need not be ashamed of it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That testifies, does it not, to quite a different attitude toward
Streckenbach and his people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: And it was not forgotten either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions to
put to the defendant.
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does that conclude the cross-examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I have only one or two questions, if Your Honor
pleases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] In the course of your examination I
understood you to say that you had never gathered to yourself any
of the art treasures of the Government General. By that I do not
suppose you to mean that you did not have them collected and
registered; you did have them collected and registered, isn’t that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Art treasures in the Government General were officially
collected and registered. The book has been submitted here in Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes. And you told the Tribunal that before you got
there one Dürer collection had already been seized—before you took
over your duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: May I ask you to understand that as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were the Dürers which were removed in Lvov before the
civilian administration was set up there. Herr Mühlmann went to
Lvov at the time and took them from the library. I had never been
in Lvov before that. These pictures were then taken directly to the
Führer headquarters or to Reich Marshal Göring, I am not sure
which.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: They were collected for Göring, that is what I am
driving at. Is that not a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: State Secretary Mühlmann, when I asked him, told me
that he came on orders of the Reich Marshal and that he had taken
them away on orders of the Reich Marshal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: And were there not some other art objects that were
collected by the Reich Marshal, and also by the Defendant Rosenberg,
at the time you told the Tribunal you were too busy with war
tasks to get involved in that sort of thing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I know of nothing of that sort in the Government
General. The Einsatzstab Rosenberg had no jurisdiction in the
Government General; and apart from the collection of the composer
Elsner and a Jewish library from Lublin I had no official obligation
to demand the return of any art treasures from Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: But there were some art treasures in your possession
when you were captured by the American forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes. They were not in my possession. I was safeguarding
them but not for myself. They were also not in my immediate
safekeeping; rather I had taken them along with me from burning
Silesia. They could not be safeguarded any other way. They were
art treasures which are so widely known that they are Numbers 1 to
10 in the list in the book—no one could have appropriated them.
You cannot steal a “Mona Lisa.”
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, I merely wanted to clear that up. I knew you
had said on interrogation there were some in your possession. I am
not trying to imply you were holding them for yourself, if you were
not. However, I think you have made that clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I should like to remark in this connection, since I attach
particular importance to the point, that these art treasures with
which we are concerned could be safeguarded only in this way.
Otherwise they would have been lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Very well. I have one other matter I would like to
clear up and I will not be long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I understood you also to say this morning that you had struggled
for some time to effect the release of the Kraków professors who
were seized and sent to Oranienburg soon after the occupation of
Poland. Now, of course, you are probably familiar with what you
said about it yourself in your diary, are you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, I said so this morning. Quite apart from what is
said in the diary, what I said this morning is the truth. You must
never forget that I had to speak among a circle of deadly enemies,
people who reported every word I said to the Führer and Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, of course, you recall that you suggested that
they should have been retained in Poland, and liquidated or imprisoned
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Never—not even if you confront me with this statement.
I never did that. On the contrary, I received the professors from
Kraków and talked to them quietly. Of all that happened I regretted
that most of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Perhaps you do not understand me. I am talking
about what you wrote in your own diary about these professors, and
I shall be glad to read it to you and make it available to you if you
care to contest it. You are not denying that you said they should
either be returned for liquidation in Poland, or imprisoned in Poland,
are you? You do not deny that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I have just told you that I did say all that merely to
hoodwink my enemies; in reality I liberated the professors. Nothing
more happened to them after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: All right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were you also talking for special purposes when you gave General
Krüger, the SS and Higher Police official, that fond farewell?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The same applies also in this case. Permit me to say,
sir, that I admit without reservation what can be admitted; but I
have also sworn to add nothing. No one can admit any more than I
have done by handing over these diaries. What I am asking is that
you do not ask me to add anything to that.
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: No, I am not asking you to add anything to it; rather,
I was trying to clear it up, because you’ve made a rather difficult
situation, perhaps, for yourself and for others. You see, if we cannot
believe what you wrote in your diary, I don’t know how you can
ask us to believe what you say here. You were writing those things
yourself, and at the time you wrote them I assume you didn’t expect
that you would be confronted with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does he not mean that this was a record of a
speech that he has made?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: In his diary, yes. It is recorded in his diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When he said, “I did that to hoodwink my
enemies”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I presume that that particular record is a
record of some speech that he made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: It is. It is entered in the diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: May I say something about that. It wasn’t that I put
myself in a difficult position; rather the changing course of the war
made the situation difficult for every administrative official.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Finally, do you recall an entry in your diary in
which you stated that you had a long hour and a half talk with the
Führer and that you had...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: When was the last conference, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, this entry is on Monday, the 17th of March
1941. It’s in your diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That was probably one of the very few conferences;
whether I was alone with him, I don’t know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: ...in which you said you and the Führer had come
to a complete agreement and that he approved all the measures, including
all the decrees, especially also the entire organization of the
country. Would you stand by that today?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No, but I might say the following: The Führer’s approval
was always very spontaneously given, but one always had to
wait a long while for it to be realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Was that one of the times you complained to him, as
you told us this morning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I constantly complained. As you know, I offered to
resign on 14 occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, I know; but on this occasion did you make
many complaints and did you have the approval of the Führer, or
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
did he turn down your complaints on this occasion of the 17th of
March, 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: The Führer took a very simple way out at the time by
saying, “You’ll have to settle that with Himmler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, that isn’t really an answer. You’ve entered in
your diary that you talked it out with him and that he approved
everything, and you make no mention in your diary of any
disappointment over the filing of a complaint. Surely, this wasn’t a
speech that you were recording in your diary; it seems to be a
factual entry on your conversations with the Führer. And my question
is simply, do you now admit that that was the situation, or are
you saying that it was a false entry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I beg your pardon, I didn’t say that I made false entries.
I never said that, and I’m not going to argue about words. I am
merely saying that you must judge the words according to the entire
context. If I emphasized in the presence of officials that the Führer
received me and agreed to my measures, then I did that to back up
my own authority. I couldn’t do that without the Führer’s agreement.
What my thoughts were, is not made clear from this. I should
like to emphasize that I’m not arguing about words and have not
asked to do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Very well, I don’t care to press it any further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, do you wish to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the first question put to you by the Soviet
Prosecutor was whether you were the chief of the NSDAP in the
Government General, and you answered “yes.” Did the Party have
any decisive influence in the Government General on political and
administrative life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No. The Party as an organization in that sphere was, of
course, only nominally under my jurisdiction, for all the Party
officials were appointed by Bormann without my being consulted.
There is no special Führer decree for the spheres of activity of the
NSDAP in the occupied territories, in which it says that these spheres
of activity are directly under Reichsleiter Bormann’s jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did your activity in that sphere of the NSDAP in
the territory of the Government General have anything at all to do
with any Security Police affairs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: No, the Party was much too small to play any important
part; it had no state function.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The next question: The Soviet Prosecution showed
you Document USSR-335. It is the Decree on Drumhead Courts-Martial
of 1943. It states in Paragraph 6: “Drumhead court-martial
sentences are to be carried out at once.” Is it correct if I say that no
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
formal legal appeal against these sentences was possible, but that a
pardon was entirely admissible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Certainly; but, nevertheless, I must say that this decree
is impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What conditions in the Government General occasioned
the issuing of this decree of 2 October 1943? I am thinking in
particular of the security situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Looking back from the more peaceful conditions of the
present time, I cannot think of any reason which might have made
such a demand possible; but if one recalls the events of war, and the
universal conflagration, it seems to have been a measure of desperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I now come back to the AB Action. Is it true that in
1939 a court-martial decree was issued providing for considerably
greater legal guarantees than that of 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that people arrested in the AB Action
were, on the strength of this court-martial decree, sentenced or
acquitted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it also true that all sentences of these courts were,
as you saw fit, to be passed on to the competent reprieve committee
under State Secretary Bühler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The prosecutor of the United States has laid it to
your charge that in Neuhaus, where you were arrested after the
collapse of the German Armed Forces, various art treasures were
found, not in your house, but in the office of the Governor General.
Is it true that you sent State Secretary Dr. Bühler with a letter to
Reich Minister Dr. Lammers, and that this letter contained a list of
these art treasures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Yes, not only that, I at once called the attention of the
head of the Pinakothek in Munich to the fact that these pictures
were there and that they should at once be safeguarded against
bombing. He also looked at the pictures and then they were put in
a bombproof cellar. I am glad I did so, for who knows what might
otherwise have happened to these valuable objects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: And now one last question. The Prosecution has submitted
Document 661-PS. This document also has a USSR exhibit
number, which I don’t know at the moment. This is a document
which has been made to have a bearing on the activities of the
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
Academy for German Law, of which you were president. The document
has the heading “Legal Formation of Germany’s Polish Policy
on Racial-Political Lines”; the legal part serves as a tect for the
Committee on the Law of Nationalities in the Academy for German
Law. I’m having this document submitted to you. Please, will you
tell me whether you’ve ever had this document in your hands before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: From whom does it come?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: That is the extraordinary part; it has the Exhibit
Number USA-300.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: Does it state anywhere who drew it up or something of
the sort?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The document has no author; nor does it show on
whose order it was compiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: I can say merely that I’ve never seen the document;
that I never gave an order for it to be drawn up; so I can say really
nothing about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: It states here that it was found in the Ministry of
Justice in Kassel. Was there a Ministry of Justice in Kassel in 1940?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: A Ministry of Justice in Kassel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRANK: That has not been in existence since 1866.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the defendant can return to his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In that case, with the permission of the Tribunal, I
shall call witness Dr. Bilfinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This document which you produced as
USSR-223, which are extracts from Defendant Frank’s diary; are
you offering that in evidence? Apparently some entries from Frank’s
diary have already been offered in evidence; others have not. Are
you wishing to offer this in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This document has already been
submitted in evidence under two numbers; the first number is
2233-PS, which was submitted by the American Prosecution, and the
second is Exhibit USSR-223, and was already submitted by us on
15 February, 1946.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see. Have these entries which you have in
this document been submitted under USSR-223? You see, the PS
number does not necessarily mean that the documents have been
offered in evidence. The PS numbers were applied to documents
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
before they were offered in evidence; but the USSR-223 does imply
that it has been offered in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This document has already been
presented in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, what the Tribunal wants to
know is whether you wish to offer this USSR-223 in evidence,
because unless it was read before it hasn’t been offered in evidence,
or it hasn’t gone into the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: We already read an excerpt on
15 February, and it is, therefore, already read into the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I retire, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Bilfinger took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you stand up, please, and will you tell
us your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>RUDOLF BILFINGER (Witness): Rudolf Bilfinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, since when were you active in the Reich
Security Main Office (RSHA), and in what position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: From the end of 1937 until the beginning of 1943 I
was government councillor in the RSHA, and later senior government
councillor and expert on legal questions, and legal questions in connection
with the police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that on two occasions and at different
times you were head of the “Administration and Law” department
attached to the commander of the Security Police and SD in Kraków?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes. In the autumn of 1940 and in 1944 I was head
of the department “Administration and Law” attached to the commander
of the Security Police and SD in Kraków.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What were the tasks you had to fulfil at different
times in the Government General—in broad outline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: In 1940 I had the task of taking over from the
Government General a number of branches of the police administration
and working in that connection under the Higher SS and
Police Leader.
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What was the legal position of the Higher SS and
Police Leader, and what was his relation to the Governor General?
Did the Higher SS and Police Leader receive his instructions concerning
the Security Police and the SD from the Governor General?
Or did he receive them direct from the Reichsführer SS and Chief of
the Police, that is, Himmler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: The Higher SS and Police Leader from the very
beginning received his instructions direct from the Reichsführer SS,
Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it furthermore true that the commander of the
Security Police and of the SD in the Government General also
received direct orders and instructions from Amt IV, the Gestapo,
and from Amt V, the Criminal Police in the RSHA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes, the commander of the Security Police received
many orders direct from the various departments of the RSHA,
particularly from departments IV and V.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did the institution of the State Secretariat for
Security, which occurred in 1942, bring about a change in the legal
position of the Governor General with reference to measures of the
Security Police and the SD?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: The appointment of a State Secretary as such did
not alter the legal position of the Governor General or of the State
Secretary. New spheres of activity were merely added to the State
Secretariat for Security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know of a decree of Reichsführer SS and
Chief of the German Police, Himmler, in the year 1939, and what
were its contents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I knew of a decree, probably dated 1939, dealing
with the appointment of the Higher SS and Police Leader, which
ruled that the Higher SS and Police Leader would receive his instructions
direct from Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The institution of the State Secretariat dated from
7 May 1942 and was based on a Führer decree. The application of
this decree called forth another decree dated 3 June 1942, which
dealt with the transfer of official business to the State Secretary for
Security. Do you know the contents of that decree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: The essential contents of the decrees which you
have mentioned are known to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that on the basis of this decree the
entire Political Police and the Criminal Police, as had been the case
before, were again subordinated to the State Secretary for Security
within the framework of the Security Police?
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: These two branches from the very beginning were
under the Higher SS and Police Leader, and later on under the State
Secretary for Security. To this extent the decree did not bring
about a change, but was merely a confirmation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it known to you that in Appendix B of that
decree there are 26 paragraphs in which all the branches of the
Security Police are transferred to the Higher SS and Police Chief
as State Secretary for Security?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know that in this decree, in Appendix B,
Jewish matters are also mentioned specifically?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know that in Paragraph 21 of Appendix B
it is ruled:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The special fields of the Security Police: Representation of
the Government General at conferences and meetings, particularly
with the central offices of the Reich, which deal with
the above-mentioned special fields.”?</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I know that as far as the sense is concerned, such
a ruling was contained therein. Whether Paragraph 21 or another
paragraph was worded this way I don’t remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it also true that on the basis of this decree the last
remains of the administrative police were removed from the administration
of the Government General and handed over to the State
Secretary for Security, who was directly under Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: That was the intention and the purpose of this
decree. But, contrary to the wording of that decree, only a few
branches were taken away from the administration; concerning the
remainder a fight ensued later. The result was, however, that all
branches of the police administration were taken away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, did the administration of the Government
General have anything to do with the establishment and administration
of concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: To the best of my knowledge, no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You were with the Chief of the Security Police and
SD in Kraków. When did you yourself hear of concentration camps
at Maidanek, Treblinka, and Lublin for the first time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: May I correct you, I was attached to the Commander
of Security Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, the Commander of the Security Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I heard of Maidanek for the first time when Lublin
and Maidanek were occupied by the Russians; and through
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
propaganda I heard for the first time what the name Maidanek meant,
when the then Governor General Frank ordered an investigation
regarding events in Maidanek and responsibility for these events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: According to your own observation, generally
speaking, what were the relations like between the Governor General
and the SS Obergruppenführer Krüger, and what were the
reasons for those relations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Relations between them were very bad from the
beginning. The reasons were partly questions of organization and
of the use of the Police, and partly essential differences of opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What do you mean by essential differences of
opinion? Do you mean different opinions regarding the treatment
of the Polish population?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I can still recollect one example which concerned
the confirmation of police court-martial sentences by Governor
General Frank. In opposition to Krüger’s opinion, he either failed to
confirm a number of sentences or else mitigated them considerably.
In this connection I remember such differences of opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Were these sentences which were passed in connection
with the so-called AB Action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I know nothing of an AB Action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You came to the Government General later, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I came to the Government General in August 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no further questions for this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel want to
ask questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. RUDOLF MERKEL (Counsel for Gestapo): May I put a few
questions to the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, the Prosecution states that the State Police was a circle
of persons formed in accordance with a common plan, and that
membership in it was voluntary. Since you had an especially high
position in the RSHA, I ask you to tell me briefly what you know
about these questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Of the members of the Secret State Police only a
small part were volunteers. The former officials, the officials of the
former political department of the headquarters of the Commissioner
of the Police, constituted the nucleus of the membership of the Secret
State Police. The various local police head offices were created from
these former political departments of the central police headquarters,
and at the same time practically all the officials from these former
political departments were taken over. In Berlin, for example, it
was Department I-A of the central police headquarters.
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from that, administrative officials were transferred from
other administrative authorities to the Secret State Police, or were
detailed to go here. As time went on people from other administrations
and offices were forced to transfer to the Secret State
Police. Thus, for instance, the entire frontier customs service was
transferred to the Secret State Police in 1944 by order of the Führer.
At about the same time the whole of the intelligence service was
transferred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the war numerous members of the Waffen-SS
who were no longer eligible for active military service were detailed
to the Secret State Police. In addition many people who originally
had had nothing to do with police work were drafted as emergency
members to the Secret State Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: If I summarize it by saying that the Secret State
Police was a Reich authority and that the German civil service law
applied to its employees, is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Was it possible for the officials to resign from the
Secret State Police easily?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: It was extremely difficult and, in fact, impossible
to resign from the Secret State Police. One could resign only in very
special circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: It has been stated here with reference to the composition
of the Secret State Police personnel that there was the
following proportion: executive officers about 20 percent; administrative
officials about 20 percent; and technical personnel approximately
60 percent. Are these figures about right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I have no general information about the composition
of the personnel; but for certain offices about which I knew
more these figures would probably apply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Under whose jurisdiction were the concentration
camps in Germany and in the occupied countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: The concentration camps were under the jurisdiction
of the Economic Administration Main Office under SS Gruppenführer
Pohl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Did the Secret State Police have anything to do
with the administration of the concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: No. It maybe that at the beginning certain concentration
camps here and there were administered directly by the
Secret State Police for a short period. That was probably the case
in individual instances. But in principle even at that time, and later
on without exception, the concentration camps were administered by
the Economic Administration Main Office.
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Do you know at all who gave orders for the liquidations
which took place in the concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: No, I know nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Can you say anything about the grounds for
protective custody? On the strength of what legal rulings was protective
custody decreed after 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Protective custody was based on the Decree of the
Reich President for the Protection of the People and the State, of
February 1933, in which a number of the basic rights of the Weimar
Constitution were rescinded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Was there later a decree by the Minister of the
Interior which dealt with protective custody, at the end of 1936 or
the beginning of 1937?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes, at that time the Protective Custody Law was
drawn up. The legal basis as such remained in force. At that time
power to decree protective custody was confined to the Secret State
Police. Before that a number of other offices, rightly or wrongly,
had decreed protective custody. To prevent this, protective custody
was then confined to the Secret State Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Is it correct that for some time you were in
France. In what capacity were you there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: In the late summer and autumn of 1943 I was commander
of the Security Police in France, in Toulouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Do you know anything about an order from the
RSHA, or from the commander of the Sipo for France, or from
individual district commanders, to the effect that ill-treatment or
torture was to be applied when prisoners were interrogated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: No, I do not know of such orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Then how do you explain the ill-treatment and
atrocities which actually took place in connection with interrogations,
proof of which has been given by the Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: It is possible that ill-treatment did occur; in a
number of cases this either took place in spite of its being forbidden,
or else it was committed by members of other German offices in
France which did not belong to the Security Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Did you, while you were active in France, hear
of any such ill-treatment either officially or by hearsay?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I never heard of any such ill-treatment at the hands
of members of the German police or the German Armed Forces. I
heard only of cases of ill-treatment carried out by groups consisting
of Frenchmen who were being employed by some German authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: Were there so-called Gestapo prisons in France?
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: No, the Security Police in France did not have
prisons of their own. They handed over their prisoners to the detention
camps of the German Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: One last question: The Prosecution has given
proof of a large number of crimes against humanity and war crimes
which were committed with the participation of the Security Police.
Can one say that these crimes were perfectly obvious and were
known to all members of the Secret State Police, or were these
crimes known only to a small circle of persons who had been ordered
directly to carry out the measures concerned? Do you know anything
about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: I didn’t quite understand the question from the
beginning. Were you referring to France or to the Security Police
in general?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: I was referring to the Security Police in general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: No ill-treatment or torture of any kind was permitted;
and, as far as I know, nothing of the kind did happen, still
less was it known generally or to a larger circle of persons. I knew
nothing about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MERKEL: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?
Is there nothing you wish to ask arising from Dr. Merkel’s cross-examination,
Dr. Seidl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have only one more question to ask the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, in Paragraph 4 of the decree of 23 June 1942 the following
ruling is made, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The SS and Police Leaders in the districts are directly
subordinate to the governors of the districts, just as the State
Secretary for Security is subordinate to the Governor
General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it does not say that the entire police organization is subordinate,
but only the police leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I ask you whether orders which had been issued by the
commanders of the Security Police and the SD were forwarded to
the governors or were sent directly to the district chiefs of the
Security Police and the SD?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: These orders were always sent directly from the
commander to the district chiefs of the Security Police and the SD.
The commander could give no instructions to the governors.
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: If I understand you correctly you mean that the
Security Police and the SD had their own official channels which
had absolutely nothing to do with the administrative construction
of the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BILFINGER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no further questions for the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: With the permission of the Tribunal, I call as the
next witness the former Governor of Kraków, Dr. Kurt von Burgsdorff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Von Burgsdorff took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KURT VON BURGSDORFF (Witness): Kurt von Burgsdorff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will
speak the pure truth—and will withhold and add nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the Government General was divided into
five districts at the head of each of which there was a governor; is
that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: From 1 December 1943 until the occupation of your
district by Soviet troops you were governor of the district Kraków?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes. To use the correct official term, I
was...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GENERAL R. A. RUDENKO (Chief Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.):
Mr. President, the defense counsel has put the question of the “occupation”
of this region by Soviet troops. I energetically protest
against such terminology and consider it a hostile move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, I have just been told that perhaps a
mistake in the translation has crept in. All I intended to say was
that, in the course of the year 1944, the area of which this witness
was governor was occupied by the Soviet troops in the course of
military action. I do not know what the Soviet prosecutor is protesting
against; it is at any rate far from my intention to make any
hostile statement here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think the point was, it was not an occupation;
it was a liberation by the Russian Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Of course; I did not want to say any more than that
the German troops were driven out of this area by the Soviet troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, will you please continue with your answer?
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I was entrusted with exercising the duties
of a governor—that is the correct official expression. Until a few
months ago I was still an officer of the Wehrmacht, and during my
entire activity in Kraków I remained an officer of the Wehrmacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, according to your observations, what basically
was the attitude of the Governor General toward the Polish
and Ukrainian people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I want to emphasize that I can answer
only for the year 1944. At that time the attitude of the Governor
General was that he wished to live in peace with the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that already in 1942 the Governor General
had given the governors the opportunity of setting up administrative
committees, comprised of Poles and Ukrainians, attached to
the district chiefs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: There was a governmental decree to this
effect. Whether that was in 1942 or not I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you yourself make use of the authorization contained
therein, and did you establish such administrative committees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: In the district of Kraków I had such a
committee established at once for every district chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, according to your observations what was
the food situation like in the Government General, and particularly
in your district?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: It was not unsatisfactory; but I must add
that the reason for that was that, in addition to the rations, the
Polish population had an extensive black market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: According to your observations what was the attitude
of the Governor General on the question of the mobilization of labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: He did not wish any workers sent outside
the Government General, because he was interested in retaining the
necessary manpower within the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Was the Church persecuted by the Governor General
in the Government General; and what basically was the attitude of
the Governor General to this question, according to your observations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Again I can answer only for my district and
for the year 1944. There was no persecution of the Church; on the
contrary, the relations with churches of all denominations were good
in my district. On my travels I always received the clergy, and I
never heard any complaint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you have any personal experience with the
Governor General with regard to this question?
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes. In the middle of January 1944 I was
appointed District Standortführer by the Governor General, who at
the same time was the Party Leader in the Government General;
that is, I was appointed to a Party office for the district of Kraków.
I pointed out to him, as I had pointed out to the Minister of the
Interior, Himmler, before, that I was a convinced church-going
Christian. The Governor General replied that he was in no way
perturbed by that and that he knew of no provision in the Party
program which prohibited it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What, according to your observations, were the
relations like between the Governor General and the administration
of the Government General on the one side, and the Security Police
and the SD on the other side?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Doubtlessly underneath they were bad,
because the Police always ended by doing only what it wanted and
did not concern itself with the administration. For that reason in
the country districts also there was real friction between the
administration offices and the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that when you took office, or shortly
after, the Governor General issued several instructions referring to
the Police? I quote from the diary of the Defendant Dr. Frank, the
entry of 4 January 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General then gave some instructions to Dr.
Von Burgsdorff with reference to his new activities. His task
will be to inform himself, as a matter of principle, of all
decisive factors in the district. Above all the Governor should
direct his efforts to opposing energetically any encroachments
by the Police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Today I no longer remember that conversation
of 4 January 1944, but it may have taken place. However,
I do remember that after I took office, at the end of November 1943,
I went to see the Governor General once more and told him that I
had heard that the relations with the Police were not good and were
scarcely tolerable for the administration. He replied that he was
doing what he could in order, as I might put it, to bring the Police
to reason. It was on the basis of this statement by the Governor
General that I definitely decided to remain in the Government General.
I had, as is known, told the Reich Minister of the Interior that
I was unwilling to go there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In your capacity as Governor did you have any
authority to issue commands to the Security Police and the SD in
your district?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: None whatsoever.
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you yourself ever see a police directive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Never. With the Police, orders are passed
down vertically, that is, directly from the Higher SS and Police
Leader to the SS and Police Leader respectively—and that is probably
the usual way—from the chief of the Security Police to the unit
commander of the Security Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In your activity as Governor did you have anything
to do with the administration of concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Never.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know who administered the concentration
camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No, not from my own experience; but I
have heard that there was some central office in Berlin under the
Reichsführer SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: When did you hear for the first time of the Maidanek
concentration camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: From you, about a fortnight ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You want to tell the Tribunal under oath...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: ...that you, although you were Governor of Kraków
in the occupied Polish territory, did not learn about that until during
your captivity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes, I am firmly convinced that I heard
about this concentration camp from you for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: When did you for the first time hear of the Treblinka
concentration camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Also from you on the same occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the Governor General is accused by the
Prosecution of issuing a summary court-martial decree in the year
1943. What at that time was the security situation in the Government
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Again I can judge only for the year 1944.
As the German troops came back from the East, it became worse and
worse, so that in my district it became increasingly difficult to carry
out any kind of administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: According to your observations what was the economic
situation like in the agricultural and industrial sectors of your
district, and is the statement justified that, allowing for wartime
conditions, the administration of the Government General had done
everything to promote economy?
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Economy in my district was at full force in
1944 both in industry and in agriculture. Some industries had been
transferred from the Reich to the Government General; and, as far
as agriculture was concerned, the administration imported large
quantities of fertilizers and seeds and the like. Horse breeding was
also greatly promoted in my district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Defendant Dr. Frank is accused of not having
done everything that was necessary with regard to public health and
sanitary conditions. What can you say about this point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I can say that in my district—again
speaking of 1944—hospitals were improved and new ones installed.
A great deal was done, especially in the fighting of epidemics.
Typhus, dysentery, and typhoid were greatly reduced by inoculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Defendant Frank is also accused of having
neglected higher education. Do you know anything about the conditions
in the Government General in regard to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: When I came into the Government General
there was no longer any higher education at all. On the basis of
other experiences I suggested immediately that Polish universities
be opened again. I contacted the president of the main department
for education, who told me that the government was already entertaining
such plans. In every one of my monthly reports I pointed
out the necessity for Polish universities, because within a short time,
or more correctly in a few years’ time, there would be a shortage of
technicians, doctors, and veterinaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Now, one last question. There was a so-called sphere
of activity of the NSDAP in the Government General; you were the
District Standortführer in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, what, according to your observations, were
the relations between the Governor General and the Head of the
Party Chancellery, Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I believe I can say without exaggeration
that they were extremely bad. As District Standortführer I combined
this office with that of District Governor and witnessed the last
great struggle of the Governor General against Bormann. The
Governor General held the view, and in this he was justified, that it
was wrong to combine the Party office with the government office.
He was afraid there would be too much interference not only by
the Police but also by the Party, and he wanted to prevent that.
Bormann, on the other hand, wanted to establish the predominance
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
of the Party over the State in the Government General as well. That
led to the most serious conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no further questions for the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the other Defense Counsel wish to
ask any other questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO FREIHERR VON LÜDINGHAUSEN (Counsel for
Defendant Von Neurath): Witness, you were at one time Under State
Secretary in the Government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and
Moravia? When was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: From the end of March 1939 until the
middle of March 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: And to whom were you directly
subordinate as Under State Secretary? The State Secretary Frank or
the Reich Protector?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: State Secretary Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: How did you come to know about
the activities of Von Neurath as Reich Protector?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: From conferences with him and personal
conversations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What kind of work did you have to
do as Under State Secretary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I was in charge of the administration
proper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Were the Police and the various SS
and police offices subordinate to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: To whom were they subordinate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: To State Secretary Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was State Secretary Frank’s
attitude to Von Neurath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: You mean officially?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Officially, yes, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Herr Von Neurath tried at first to get on
with Herr Frank; but the stronger Frank’s position became, the
more impossible that was. State Secretary Frank, later Minister
Frank, had behind him the entire power of the SS and the Police,
and finally Hitler also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: From whom did Frank get his
orders directly?
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: As far as I know, from Himmler; however,
I saw that on one or two or three occasions he received direct orders
from Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: And that happened mostly without
Von Neurath being consulted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: That I cannot say, but I assume so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Was it possible for Frank to perform
his political functions independently within his sphere of
activity, or did he have to have the approval of Herr Von Neurath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Whether he was authorized or allowed to
do so, I should not like to decide, but at any rate he did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Were Herr Von Neurath and Herr
Frank of the same opinion concerning the policy towards the Czech
people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I did not understand your question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did Herr Von Neurath agree with
the policy toward the Czech people pursued by Frank or his superior,
Himmler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Could he carry through his aims?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: He could not do anything, confronted as he
was by Himmler’s and Hitler’s immense power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was Herr Von Neurath’s own
policy and attitude?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: At the beginning I spoke very often about
these things to Herr Von Neurath. On the basis of the decree of
15 March he hoped and believed he could get the Germans and
Czechs in the Protectorate to live together reasonably and peacefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: But as Frank’s position became
stronger, that became more and more difficult?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you remember that in the
middle of November 1939 serious disturbances broke out among the
students in Prague?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you also remember that on the
day after these incidents Herr Von Neurath and Frank flew to
Berlin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you remember that Frank returned
from Berlin alone on the same day?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I believe I can recall that Frank returned
on the same day, but I do not know whether he returned alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: You don’t know whether Herr Von
Neurath returned with him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything else about
the incidents connected with the students’ disturbances and what the
consequences were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: They resulted, as far as I remember, in the
execution of several students and in the closing of the universities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know whether the universities
were closed on Himmler’s order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about the
attitude of Herr Von Neurath towards the Catholic and Protestant
Churches?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: His attitude was always above reproach,
and there were no difficulties with the churches during the time that
I was in the Protectorate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know that Herr Von Neurath
was in contact with the Archbishop of Prague until the latter’s
death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No, I don’t know anything about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything concerning
whether, during the term of office of Herr Von Neurath, with his
approval or upon his orders, art treasures of any kind, pictures,
monuments, sculptures, libraries, or the like, belonging either to the
State or to private owners, were confiscated and removed from the
country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: It is certain, absolutely certain, that he did
not order anything of the sort. Whether he consented in any way to
this I do not know, but I do not believe so. I remember one incident
in the Malta Palace, where some Reich office—I don’t remember
today which it was—removed art treasures. Herr Von Neurath
immediately did everything to make good this damage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know that the customs
union which had been ordered by Berlin from the very beginning
between the Protectorate and Germany was not established for a
long time because of Herr Von Neurath’s intervention?
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes. I definitely know about that. However,
in the interest of the truth, I have to add that State Secretary
Frank also was against the customs union, because, like Herr Von
Neurath, he believed that the economy of the Protectorate would be
damaged by the stronger economy of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: While Von Neurath was Reich Protector,
was there any compulsory deportation of workers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I am convinced that that did not happen.
Workers were recruited, but in an entirely regular manner. That
was the case while I was in the Protectorate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know whether Von Neurath
made travel in or out of the Protectorate dependent on official
approval?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Whether or not Von Neurath did that, I do
not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about the
closing of the secondary schools?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What do you know about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I remember that the closing of the secondary
schools was a necessary consequence of the closing of the universities.
There were too many secondary schools in the Protectorate.
Not all of them were closed by any means. On the other hand
technical schools were greatly expanded and new ones established.
I cannot remember anything more exact about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about Von
Neurath’s attitude towards the Germanization of Czechoslovakia as
intended by Himmler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes, I remember the memorandum which
Von Neurath sent to Hitler about the whole affair. That memorandum
was intended to defer Himmler’s plans for forced
Germanization. Von Neurath expressed the view, which he had
frequently mentioned to me, that in the interest of peace in the
Protectorate he did not advocate these attempts at Germanization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I have no more questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Tell us, please, when you first joined the National
Socialist Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: On 1 May 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: And did you achieve office in any of its affiliated
organizations?
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I was an honorary SA Gruppenführer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Any other honors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Then for a few years, just as I had been
during the democratic regime, I was legal advisor to the administration
of Saxony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Weren’t you also an Oberbannführer in the HJ, the
Hitler-Jugend?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I once became Oberbannführer on the
occasion of the Reich Youth Leader’s visit to Prague. But that was
purely a gesture of courtesy, which had no consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to mention again, since you speak of Party offices,
that, as was said before, because of my post as Governor of Kraków
I was District Standortführer from the middle of January 1944 until
the end, that is the middle of January 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You also received the gold badge of the Hitler Youth,
did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Weren’t you in some way associated with Reinhard
Heydrich when you were in Prague?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: I was with Heydrich until the middle
of 1942. Then, as is generally known, because of the course pursued
by Heydrich, I left the Protectorate, and at 55 years of age I went
into the army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: What position did you occupy with relation to
Heydrich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: The same as under Herr Von Neurath; I
was Under State Secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Let me put it to you this way: You told us that you
never heard of Maidanek, the concentration camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: And you never heard of Auschwitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Of Auschwitz, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Had you heard of an installation known as Lublin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Of Lublin? Not of the concentration camp
but of the city of Lublin, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Did you know of a concentration camp by the name
of Lublin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You did know, I assume, of many other concentration
camps by name?
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON BURGSDORFF: Only of German camps, yes—of Dachau
and Buchenwald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no more questions for the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Who is your next witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The next witness would be the former secretary of
the Governor General, Fräulein Kraffczyk. However, if I understood
the Tribunal correctly yesterday, this session will end at 1630 hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now until Tuesday
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, I shall dispense with the hearing of
the witness Struve, Chief of the Central Department for Agriculture
and Food in the Government General. With the permission of the
Tribunal I am now calling witness Dr. Joseph Bühler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Bühler took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>JOSEPH BÜHLER (Witness): Joseph Bühler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, how long have you known Defendant
Dr. Hans Frank; and what were the positions in which you worked
with him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I have known Herr Frank since 1 October 1930. I
worked with him in government spheres of service from the end of
March 1933. I served under him officially when he was Minister of
Justice in Bavaria; later when he was Reich Commissioner for
Justice; and still later when he was Minister. From the end of
September 1939 Herr Frank employed me in an official capacity in
the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In what capacity did you serve in the Government
General at the end?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: From about the second half of 1940 I was state secretary
in the government of the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Were you yourself a member of the Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I have been a Party member since 1 April 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did you exercise any functions in the Party or any
of the affiliated organizations of the Party, particularly in the SA
or the SS?
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I never held an office in the Party. I was never a
member of the SA or the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I now come to the time during which you were state
secretary to the chief of the government in the Government General.
Will you please tell me what the relations were between the
Governor General on the one side and the Higher SS and Police
Leader on the other side?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I might perhaps say in advance that my sphere of
activity did not touch upon police matters, matters relating to the
Party, or military matters in the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relations of the Governor General to the Higher SS and
Police Leader, Obergruppenführer Krüger, who was allocated to
him by the Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German Police were,
from the very beginning, made difficult by essential differences of
opinion. These differences of opinion concerned the conception of the
task and the position of the Police in general in an orderly state
system, as well as the conception in particular of the position and
tasks of the Police in the Government General. The Governor
General held the view that the Police must be the servant and the
organ of the executive of the state and that accordingly he and
the state authorities should give orders to the Police and that this
assignment of tasks involved a limitation of the sphere of activity
of the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Higher SS and Police Leader Krüger, on the other hand,
held the view that the Police in general had, of course, to fulfill
tasks originating with the executive of the state but that in fulfilling
these tasks it was not bound by the instructions of the administrative
authorities, that this was a matter of technical police
questions, decisions about which administrative authorities could
not make and were not in a position to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding the power to give orders to the Police, it was Krüger’s
view that because of the effectiveness and unity of police activity
in all occupied territories, such power to issue orders had to rest
with the central authority in Berlin and that he and only he could
issue orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the duties of the Police were concerned, it was Krüger’s
opinion that the Governor General’s view regarding the limitation
of these duties as unfounded for the very reason that he, as Higher
SS and Police Leader, was simultaneously the deputy of the Reichsführer
SS in the latter’s capacity as Reich Commissioner for the
Preservation of German Nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the relation of the Police to the question of Polish
policy was concerned, it was Krüger’s view that, in connection with
work in non-German territory, police considerations would have to
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
play a predominant role and that with police methods everything
could be achieved and everything could be prevented. This overestimation
of the Police led, for instance, to the fact that, during
later arguments between the Police and the administration regarding
their respective spheres of work, matters concerning non-German
groups were listed among the competences of the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know that as early as 1939 Reichsführer SS
Himmler issued a restricted decree, according to which the handling
of all police matters was his own concern or the concern of his
Higher SS and Police Leader?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That this was the case became clear to me from the
actions taken by the Police. I did not see a decree to this effect, but
I can state this much: The Police in the Government General acted
exactly as in the directives which I have described before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, in 1942, by decree of the Führer, a State
Secretariat for Security was instituted. At whose instigation was
this instituted and what was the position taken by the Governor
General in that connection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: This decree was preceded by a frightful campaign of
hatred against the person of the Governor General. The institution
of the State Secretariat for Security was considered by the Police
a step, an important step, in the fight for the removal of the
Governor General. The matters specified in that decree, or at least
the majority of them, were not being transferred to the Police
now for the first time, but the actual state of affairs was—the
actual course of events had already been—in conformity to the
contents of this decree before it was issued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In the decree implementing this Führer decree and
dated 3 June 1942 all the police spheres of activities which were to
be transferred to the State Secretary were given in two lists; in an
Appendix A, the tasks of the Regular Police; and in an Appendix B,
the tasks of the Security Police. Were these police matters at that
time transferred completely to the State Secretary and thus to the
police sector?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The administration did not like giving up these
matters; so where the Police had not already got hold of them, they
were given up only with reluctance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You are thinking first of all of the spheres of the
so-called administrative police, health police, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, are you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, that is to say, the police in charge of communications,
health, food, and such matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: If I have understood your statements correctly, you
mean that the entire police system, Security Police as well as SD
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
and Regular Police, was directed by the central office, either by
Himmler himself or by the Reich Security Main Office through the
Higher SS and Police Leader?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: In general according to my observations, it was
possible for the Security Police to receive orders direct from Berlin
without their going through Krüger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: And now another question: Is it correct that resettlements
were carried out in the Government General, by Reichsführer
SS Himmler in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for the Preservation
of German Nationality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Resettlements, in the opinion of the Governor General,
even if carried out decently, always caused unrest among the population.
We had no use for that in the Government General. Also,
these resettlements always caused a falling off of agricultural production.
For these reasons, the Governor General and the Government
of the Government General did not, as a matter of principle,
carry out resettlements during the war. To the extent that such
resettlements were carried out, it was done exclusively by the Reich
Commissioner for the Preservation of German Nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that the Governor General, because of
this arbitrary resettlement policy, repeatedly had serious arguments
with Himmler, Krüger, and SS Gruppenführer Globocznik?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That is correct. The intention of preventing such
resettlements always led to arguments and friction between the
Higher SS and Police Leader and the Governor General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Defendant Dr. Frank is accused by the Prosecution
of the seizure and confiscation of industrial and private
property. What basically was the attitude of the Governor General
to such questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The legal provisions in this sphere of the law originated
with the Delegate for the Four Year Plan. Confiscation of private
property and possessions in the annexed Eastern territories and in
the Government General was subject to the same regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decree of the Delegate for the Four Year Plan provided for
the creation of a trust office—the Haupttreuhandstelle Ost—with its
central administration in Berlin. The Governor General did not
want to have the affairs of the Government General administered in
Berlin, and therefore he opposed the administration of property in
the Government General being entrusted to the Haupttreuhandstelle
Ost. Without interference by the Delegate for the Four Year Plan,
he established his own rules for confiscations in the Government
General and his own trust office. That trust office was headed by
an experienced higher official from the Ministry of Economy of
Saxony.
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What happened to the factories and works which
were situated in the Government General and were formerly the
property of the Polish State?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Factories, as far as they were included in the armament
program, were taken over by the military sector, that is to
say, by the Inspector for Armaments, who was subordinate to the
OKW and later to Minister Speer. Factories outside the armament
sector, which had belonged to the former Polish State, the Governor
General tried to consolidate into a stock company and to administer
them separately as property of the Government General. The chief
shareholder in this company was the Treasury of the Government
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: That is to say, these factories were administered
entirely separately by the Reich Treasury?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution submitted an extract from Frank’s
diary in evidence under Number USA-281 (Document Number
2233(d)-PS.) This is a discussion of Jewish problems. In this connection
Frank said, among other things:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“My attitude towards the Jews is based on the expectation
that they will disappear; they must go away. I have started
negotiations for deporting them to the East. This question
will be discussed at a large meeting in Berlin in January,
to which I shall send State Secretary Dr. Bühler. This conference
is to take place at the Reich Security Main Office
in the office of SS Obergruppenführer Heydrich. In any case
Jewish emigration on a large scale will begin.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask you now, did the Governor General send you to Berlin for
that conference; and if so, what was the subject of the conference?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, I was sent to the conference and the subject of
the conference was the Jewish problem. I might say in advance
that from the beginning Jewish questions in the Government General
were considered as coming under the jurisdiction of the Higher SS
and Police Leader and handled accordingly. The handling of Jewish
matters by the state administration was supervised and merely
tolerated by the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the years 1940 and 1941 incredible numbers of people,
mostly Jews, were brought into the Government General in spite
of the objections and protests of the Governor General and his
administration. This completely unexpected, unprepared for, and
undesired bringing in of the Jewish population from other territories
put the administration of the Government General in an extremely
difficult position.
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Accommodating these masses, feeding them, and caring for their
health—combating epidemics for instance—almost, or rather, definitely
overtaxed the capacity of the territory. Particularly threatening
was the spread of typhus, not only in the ghettos but also
among the Polish population and the Germans in the Government
General. It appeared as if that epidemic would spread even to the
Reich and to the Eastern Front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Heydrich’s invitation to the Governor General
was received. The conference was originally supposed to take place
in November 1941, but it was frequently postponed and it may have
taken place in February 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because of the special problems of the Government General I
had asked Heydrich for a personal interview and he received me.
On that occasion, among many other things, I described in particular
the catastrophic conditions which had resulted from the arbitrary
bringing of Jews into the Government General. He replied that for
this very reason he had invited the Governor General to the conference.
The Reichsführer SS, so he said, had received an order
from the Führer to round up all the Jews of Europe and to settle
them in the Northeast of Europe, in Russia. I asked him whether
this meant that the further arrival of Jews in the Government
General would cease, and whether the hundreds of thousands of
Jews who had been brought into the Government General without
the permission of the Governor General would be moved out again.
Heydrich promised me both these things. Heydrich said furthermore
that the Führer had given an order that Theresienstadt, a town in
the Protectorate, would become a reservation in which old and sick
Jews, and weak Jews who could not stand the strains of resettlement,
were to be accommodated in the future. This information
left me definitely convinced that the resettlement of the Jews, if
not for the sake of the Jews, then for the sake of the reputation
and prestige of the German people, would be carried out in a
humane fashion. The removal of the Jews from the Government
General was subsequently carried out exclusively by the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might add that Heydrich demanded, particularly for himself,
his office, and its branches, the exclusive and uninterrupted competence
and control in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What concentration camps in the Government
General did you know about during your activity as State Secretary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The publications in the press during the summer of
1944 called my attention to the Maidanek camp for the first time.
I did not know that this camp, not far from Lublin, was a concentration
camp. It had been installed as an economic establishment
of the Reichsführer SS, in 1941 I think. Governor Zörner came to
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
visit me at that time and he told me that he had objected to the
establishment of this camp when he talked to Globocznik, as it
would endanger the power supply of the city of Lublin; and there
were objections, too, on the part of the Police with regard to the
danger of epidemics. I informed the Governor General of this and
he in turn sent for Globocznik. Globocznik stated to the Governor
General that certain workshops for the needs of the Waffen-SS at
the front had been erected on that site by him. He mentioned
workshops for dressing furs but he also mentioned a timber yard
which was located there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these workshops for dressing furs, as I heard, fur articles
from the collection of furs were altered for use at the front. At
any rate, Globocznik stated that he had installed these workshops
in compliance with Himmler’s command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Governor General prohibited the erection of any further
installations until all questions were settled with the police in charge
of building and blueprints had been submitted to the state offices, in
other words until all rules had been complied with, which apply to
the construction of buildings. Globocznik never submitted these
blueprints. With regard to the events inside the camp, no concrete
information ever reached the outside. It surprised the Governor
General just as much as it surprised me when the world press
released the news about Maidanek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the Prosecution has submitted a document,
Number 437-PS, Exhibit USA-610, which is a memorandum from
the Governor General to the Führer, dated 19 June 1943. I think
you yourself drafted that memorandum. On Page 35 a report of the
commander of the Security Police is mentioned and quoted verbatim
in part. This report of the Security Police mentions also the name
of Maidanek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you at that time realize that this Maidanek was identical
or probably identical with that camp near Lublin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No. I assumed that, like Auschwitz, it was a camp
outside the territory of the Government General, because the
Governor General had repeatedly told the Police and the Higher SS
and Police Leader that he did not wish to have concentration camps
in the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Under whose jurisdiction was the administration of
concentration camps in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I don’t know because I did not know of the existence
of the camps. In August, on the occasion of a visit to the reception
camp at Pruszkow, I heard about the administration of concentration
camps in general. At that time I brought instructions from
Himmler to the camp commandant, according to which transport
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
of the inhabitants of Warsaw who had been removed from the city
to concentration camps was to cease forthwith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Was that after the uprising in Warsaw?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It was during it; it must have been on or about 18 or
19 August 1944. The camp commandant, whose name I have
forgotten, told me at the time that he did not know about that
order, and that he could receive instructions only from the Chief
of Concentration Camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know whether the Governor General himself
ever sent a Pole, a Ukrainian, or a Jew to a concentration camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Nothing like that ever happened, when I was present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it true that a large number of Jewish workmen
who were working in the castle at Kraków were taken away by
the Security Police against the wishes of the Governor General and
during his absence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: This Jewish workers’ colony is known to me because
I lived in that castle. I also know that the Governor General always
took care of the maintenance of this colony. And the chief of the
Chancellery of the Government General, Ministerial Counsellor Keit,
once told me that this group of Jewish workers had been taken
away by force by the Police during the absence of the Governor
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I now come to the so-called AB Action, this extraordinary
pacification action. What were the circumstances which
occasioned this action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It may have been about the middle of May 1940 when
one morning I was called from the government building, where I
performed my official work, to visit the Governor General in the
castle. I think I remember that Reich Minister Seyss-Inquart had
also been called. There we met the Governor General together
with some officials of the Police. The Governor General stated that,
in the opinion of the Police, an extreme act of pacification was
necessary. The security situation at that time, as far as I remember,
was this: Certain remnants of the Polish armed forces were still
roaming about in deserted forest regions, causing unrest among
the population, and probably giving military training to young
Poles. At that time, that is May 1940, the Polish people had recovered
from the shock which they had suffered at the sudden
defeat in 1939; and they began openly, with little caution and
without experience, to start a resistance movement everywhere.
This picture I remember clearly because of the statement given by
the Police on that or some other occasion.
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: May I interrupt you and quote from Frank’s diary,
an entry of 16 May 1940. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The general war situation forces us to regard the security
situation in the Government General very seriously. From
a number of symptoms and actions one can draw the conclusion
that a large organized wave of resistance among the
Poles is present in the country awaiting the outbreak of
greater and violent events. Thousands of Poles are reported
to have been organized secretly and to have been armed,
and are being incited to carry out acts of violence of all sorts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Governor General quoted some recent examples, as,
for instance, an uprising in certain villages under the leadership of
Major Huballa in the district of Radom; the murder of families of
German blood in Józefów; the murder of the mayor of Grasienta,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Illegal pamphlets, inciting to rebellion, are being distributed
and even posted up everywhere; and there can therefore be
no doubt that the security situation is extremely serious.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did the Governor General express himself in that manner at the
time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: When I took part in that meeting, the Governor
General spoke about the situation for some time, but the details I
cannot recollect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What happened after that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I had only one impression. In the previous months
the Governor General had succeeded, by taking great pains, in
imposing on the Police a procedure for courts-martial which had to
be observed in making arrests and dealing with suspicious persons.
Furthermore, the Police had to concede that the Governor General
could refer the sentences of a summary court-martial to a reprieve
commission and that the execution of sentences could take place
only after the sentences had been confirmed by the Governor
General. The statements of the Governor General during this
conference in the middle of May 1940 made me fear that the Police
might see in these statements the possibility for evading the court-martial
and reprieve procedure imposed on them. For that reason
I asked the Governor General for permission to speak after he had
finished his statement. The Governor General cut me short at first
and stated that he wanted to dictate something to the secretary in
a hurry, which the latter was then to dictate to a stenotypist at
once and then put it into its final version. Thereupon the Governor
General dictated some authorization, or order, or some such document;
and with absolute certainty I remember that after he had
finished dictating, the secretary and I think, quite definitely,
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
Brigadeführer Streckenbach, the Commander of the Regular Police,
left the room. I am saying this in advance because it explains the
fact that everything that happened afterwards has not been recorded
in the minutes. The secretary was no longer present in the room.
I expressed my fears, saying that these requirements laid down for
court-martial procedure should be observed under all circumstances.
I am not claiming any particular merit in this connection, because
if I had not done it then this objection would have been raised, I
am convinced, by Reich Minister Seyss-Inquart, or the Governor
General himself would have realized the danger which his statements
might have caused in this respect. At any rate, in reply to
my objection, and without any debate, the Governor General stated
at once that arrests and shootings could take place only in accordance
with the court-martial procedure, and that sentences of the
summary courts-martial would have to be examined by the reprieve
commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the ensuing period these instructions were followed. I assume
that it is certain that the reprieve commission received all sentences
pronounced by these courts-martial and dealt with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Another entry in Frank’s diary, 12 July 1940, leads
one to the conclusion that at first these leaders of the resistance
movement concerned were merely arrested. I quote a statement of
the Governor General:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Regarding the question what is to be done with the political
criminals caught in connection with the AB Action, a discussion
is to take place in the near future with State Secretary
Dr. Bühler, Obergruppenführer Krüger, Brigadeführer
Streckenbach, and Ministerial Counsellor Wille.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Who was Ministerial Counsellor Wille, and what task did he
have in that connection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I might say in advance that there is a gap in my
memory which makes it impossible for me to say for certain when
the Governor General told Brigadeführer Streckenbach that in all
cases he would have to observe court-martial procedure and respect
the reprieve commission. On the other hand, I think I can remember
for certain that at the time this discussion took place between
Krüger, Streckenbach, Wille, and me, arrests only had taken place
and no executions. Ministerial Counsellor Wille was the head of the
Department of Justice in the Government and was the competent
official for all matters concerning reprieves. The Governor General
wanted these matters dealt with by a legally trained, experienced
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the conference with Krüger, Streckenbach, and Wille it
had been ruled that the persons who had been arrested up to
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
that time were to be subjected to court-martial procedure and that
sentences had to be dealt with by the reprieve commission. The
Police were not exactly enthusiastic about this. I remember that
Krüger told me privately after the conference that the Governor
General was a jack-in-the-box with whom one couldn’t work, and
that in the future he would go his own way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, the Tribunal thinks that this has
been gone into in too great detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, I am coming to the end of my questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, during a Police meeting in 1940 on 30 May, the Defendant
Dr. Frank mentioned among other things the following: “The
difficulties we had had with the Kraków professors were terrible.
If we had handled the matter here, it would have taken a different
course.” Who arrested these professors, and to what extent was the
Governor General concerned with this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: On 7 or 8 November 1939, when the Governor General
arrived in Kraków to begin his activities, all professors of the
University of Kraków were arrested by the Security Police without
his knowledge and taken away to concentration camps in the Reich.
Among them were acquaintances of the Governor General, with
whom shortly before he had had social and academic connections
through the Academy for German Law. The Governor General used
his influence on Obergruppenführer Krüger persistently and uninterruptedly
until he achieved the release of the majority of these professors
from concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This statement of his, which contradicts this, was made, in my
opinion, for the purpose of placating the Police, for the Police did
not like releasing these professors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What basically was the attitude of the Governor
General concerning mobilization of labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Governor General and the Government of the
Government General were always attempting to get as many Polish
workers for the Reich as possible. It was clear to us, however, that
the employment of force in recruiting workers might bring about
temporary advantages but that recruitment of workers in that way
would not promise much success in the long run. The Governor
General gave me instructions, therefore, to conduct extensive and
intensive propaganda in favor of employment in the Reich and to
oppose all use of force in the recruitment of workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand the Governor General wanted to make his
recruitment of workers for the Reich successful by demanding decent
treatment for Polish workers in the Reich. He negotiated for many
years with the Reich Commissioner for the Allocation of Labor, Gauleiter
Sauckel, and improvements were in fact achieved. The
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
Governor General was especially opposed to the identifying of Jews
and Poles by distinguishing marks in the Reich. I remember a letter
from Reich Commissioner Sauckel in which he informed the
Governor General that he had made every effort to insure the same
treatment for Polish workers as for other foreign workers, but that
his efforts were no longer crowned by success whenever the influence
of the Reichsführer SS opposed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, I now come to another point. Under Number
USA-275 the Prosecution has submitted Document 1061-PS, which
is a report of Brigadeführer Stroop on the destruction of the ghetto
in Warsaw. Were you, or the Governor General, informed beforehand
about the measures planned by the Security Police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I certainly was not. As to the Governor General, I do
not know that he was informed about any such plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What did you learn afterwards about the events at
the ghetto in Warsaw in 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I heard what practically everybody heard—that an
uprising had broken out in the ghetto which had long been prepared;
that the Jews had used the building materials given them for the
purpose of air-raid protection to set up defense works; and that
during the uprising violent resistance was encountered by the German
troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I now come to the Warsaw uprising of 1944. To what
extent did the administration of the Government General participate
in the quelling of that revolt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: As our comrades in Warsaw were encircled by the
insurrectionists, we asked the Governor General to apply to the
Führer for assistance to bring about a speedy quelling of the Warsaw
revolt. Apart from that the administration assisted in the welfare of
the population in connection with the evacuation in the battle zone
of the quarters that were to be destroyed. But the administration
did not exercise any authority here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: On 4 November 1945 you made an affidavit. The
affidavit bears the number 2476-PS. I shall now read to you that
affidavit, which is very brief, and I shall ask you to tell me whether
the contents are correct. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the course of the quelling of the Warsaw revolt in August
1944, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants of Warsaw
(a Polish estimate) were taken away to German concentration
camps. As a result of a <span class='it'>démarche</span> made by the Governor General,
Dr. Frank, to the office of Reichsführer SS Himmler, the
latter prohibited further deportations. The Governor General
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
tried to secure the release of the 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants
of Warsaw who had already been taken to concentration
camps in the Reich. The Chief of the Reich Security Main
Office, Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner, refused this request,
made in writing as well as orally on the occasion of a
visit of mine to Berlin in September or October 1944, on the
grounds that these inhabitants of Warsaw were being used in
the secret manufacture of armaments in the Reich and that
therefore a general release was out of the question. However,
he would be willing to consider individual applications favorably.
Individual applications for release from concentration
camps were granted by Kaltenbrunner during the subsequent
months.</p>

<p>“Contrary to the Polish estimate, the number of persons taken
from Warsaw to concentration camps in the Reich was estimated
to be small by Kaltenbrunner. I myself reported to my
office Kaltenbrunner’s statement regarding the number of
internees, and after a renewed investigation I found that the
above-mentioned figure of 50,000 to 60,000 was correct. These
were the people who had been taken to concentration camps
in Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now ask you, are the contents of this affidavit, made before an
American officer, correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I can supplement it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Before he supplements it, is it in evidence?
Has it yet been put in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: It has the number 2476-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That doesn’t prove it has been put in evidence.
Has it been put in evidence? Dr. Seidl, you know quite well what
“put in evidence” means. Has it been put in evidence? Has it got a
USA exhibit number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: No, it has not a USA exhibit number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then you are offering it in evidence, are you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I don’t want to submit it formally in evidence; but
I do want to ask the witness about the contents of this affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But it is a document, and if you are putting
it to the witness, you must put it in evidence and you must give it
an exhibit number. You cannot put documents to the witness and
not put them in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In that case I submit this document as Document
Number Frank-1.
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now ask you, Witness, whether the contents of this affidavit are
correct, and, if so, whether you can supplement this affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, I should like to supplement it briefly. It is possible
that I went to see Kaltenbrunner twice about that question—not
only once—and after Kaltenbrunner had refused to release these
people the second time, on the strength of my experiences with the
camp commandant in Camp Pruszkow, I had the impression that it
was not in Kaltenbrunner’s power to order such a release. He didn’t
talk to me about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: But from his statements you had the impression that
perhaps he too did not have the power to release those people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: During those conferences I had brought up questions
about the Polish policy, and from these conferences I had the impression
that I might gain Kaltenbrunner’s interest in a reasonable
Polish policy and win him over as an ally in negotiations with
Himmler. At any rate, talking to me, he condemned the methods of
force used by Krüger. I gathered from these statements that Kaltenbrunner
did not want to see methods of force employed against the
Poles and that he would have helped me if he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Soviet Prosecution has submitted a document
bearing the Exhibit Number USSR-128 (Document Number 3305-PS).
It is a teleprinted message from the intelligence office of the Higher
SS and Police Leader East addressed to the Governor General and
signed by Dr. Fischer, then Governor of Warsaw. Under Figure 2 it
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Obergruppenführer Von dem Bach has been given the new
task of pacifying Warsaw, that is to say, of laying Warsaw
level with the ground during the war, except where military
considerations of its value as a fortress are involved. Before
the destruction, all raw materials, all textiles, and all furniture
will be removed from Warsaw. The main task will fall to the
civil administration.</p>

<p>“I herewith inform you that this new Führer decree regarding
the razing of Warsaw is of the greatest significance for the
further new policy regarding the Poles.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As far as you can recollect, how did the Governor General receive
and view that telegram? And to what extent was his basic attitude
altered on the strength of that message?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: This telegram referred to instructions which Obergruppenführer
Von dem Bach had received from the Reichsführer
SS. The administration in the Government General did not welcome
the destruction of Warsaw. On the contrary, I remember that,
together with the Governor General, ways which might be used to
avoid the destruction of Warsaw were discussed. Just what was
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
really tried I cannot recollect. It may be that further steps were not
taken because of the impossibility of achieving anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I now turn to another subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We might adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, Your Honors, before I continue the
interrogation of the witness Dr. Bühler, I should like to inform you
that I forego the interrogation of the witness Helene Kraffczyk; so
this witness will be the last one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, the Defendant Dr. Frank has been accused
by the Prosecution of not having done everything within his power
to ensure the feeding of the population of the Government General.
What can you say about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The decisive reason, the real cause, why the population
in the Government General could not be supplied as efficiently and
as satisfactorily as in Germany was the lack of co-operation on the
part of the Polish population in the measures taken by the Germans
to bring about a just and equal distribution of food quotas. This lack
of co-operation was caused by patriotic considerations, the aversion
to German domination, and the continuous, effective propaganda
from the outside. I do not believe that there was a single country in
Europe where so much was pillaged, stolen, and diverted to the
black market, where so much was destroyed and so much damage
was done in order to sabotage the food program, as in the Government
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give one example: All the dairy machinery, which had been
provided with great pains, and the chain of dairies, which had been
organized with difficulty, were destroyed again and again so that a
more or less comprehensive control of milk and fat supplies could
not be carried out. I estimate that the fat sold on the free market
and the black market in the Government General was several times
the quantity of that controlled and distributed officially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another decisive reason may be seen in the fact that the Government
General had been carved out of a hitherto self-contained
governmental and economic structure and that no consideration had
been given effecting a proper economic balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The large centers of consumption in the Government General,
that is to say, the cities such as Warsaw, Kraków, later Lvov, and
also the industrial area in the center of Poland, had previously
received their supplies to a very large extent directly from the
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
country through the standing market. In these areas of the Government
General there was a lack of granaries; a lack of refrigerators;
there was no systematic chain of dairies; and storehouses of all kinds
were lacking—all necessary for the directing or controlling of a
supply economy by the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Government General had to construct all these things step
by step, and therefore the supplying of the population was proportionately
difficult. It was not intended to supply the population
fully right away; the supplies were to be improved gradually. I
always saw to it that the directives issued for combating the black
market allowed margins for the acquisition of foodstuffs and that
the inhabitants of the cities were given the opportunity of contacting
the producers. In 1942 the rations were to have been increased; then
an order came from the Delegate for the Four Year Plan that rations
were not to be increased and that certain quotas of foodstuffs were
to be allocated to the Reich. Most of these foodstuffs were not taken
out of the area, but were consumed by the Armed Forces on the
spot. The Governor General fought continually against the authorities
of the Four Year Plan, in order to achieve an increase and an
improvement in the food supplies for the Polish population. That
struggle was not without success. In many cases it was possible to
increase the rations considerably, especially those of the workers in
armament industries, and other privileged groups of the working
population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To sum up I should like to say that it was not easy for the
population of the Government General to get its daily food requirements.
On the other hand there were no famines and no hunger
epidemics in the Government General. A Polish and Ukrainian
auxiliary committee, which had delegations in all districts of the
Government General, saw to the supply of foodstuffs for those parts
of the population which were in greatest need. I used my influence
to have this committee supplied with the largest possible amount of
foodstuffs, so that it should be able to pursue its welfare work
successfully, and it is known to me that that committee took special
care of the children of large cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, what were the measures that the Governor
General took to safeguard art treasures in the areas under his
administration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: With a decree of 16 December 1939 the Reichsführer
SS, in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for the Preservation of
German Nationality, had already ordered, without informing the
Governor General, that all art treasures of the Government General
were to be confiscated and transported to the Reich. The Government
General was successful in preventing this transport to a great
extent.
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a man arrived in the Government General from the Delegate
for the Four Year Plan, State Secretary Mühlmann, who
claimed to have plenary authority from the Delegate for the Four
Year Plan. I asked to see that authorization. It was signed, not by
Göring himself, but by somebody in his circle, Gritzbach. He was
entrusted with the task of safeguarding the art treasures of the
Government General in the interests of the Reich. In order to bring
this commissioner—provided as he was with plenary authority from
the Reich—into line with the Government General, the Governor
General entrusted to him, in addition, the task of collecting together
the art treasures of the Government General. He collected these art
treasures and also had catalogues printed; and I know, from conferences
which took place with the Governor General, that the
Governor always attached the greatest importance to having these
art treasures kept within the area of the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The prosecution, under Number USA-378, that is
Document 1709-PS, submitted a report about the investigation of the
entire activity of the Special Commissioner for the Collection and
Safeguarding of Art and Cultural Treasures in the Government
General. On Page 6 of that report it reads, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Reason for investigation: Order of the State Secretary of the
Government of the Government General of 30 June 1942 to
investigate the entire activity of the Special Commissioner
appointed for the collection and safeguarding of art and
cultural treasures in the Government General, according to
the decree of the Governor General of 16 December 1939.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask you now what caused you in 1942 to give this order for
investigation, and did the report lead to serious charges?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The investigation was found necessary because of the
possibility of a collision of duties, in the case of State Secretary
Mühlmann, between the order given by the Reich and the order
given by the Governor General. I had also heard that some museum
pieces had not been properly taken care of. The investigation showed
that State Secretary Mühlmann could not be blamed in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution has submitted another document,
3042-PS, Exhibit USA-375. It is an affidavit by Dr. Mühlmann, and
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I was the Special Commissioner of the Governor General of
Poland, Hans Frank, for the safeguarding of art treasures in
the Government General, from October 1939 to September
1943. Göring in his capacity as chairman of the Reich Defense
Council had commissioned me with this duty.</p>

<p>“I confirm that it was the official policy of the Governor General,
Hans Frank, to take into safekeeping all important art
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
treasures which belonged to Polish public institutions, private
collections, and the Church. I confirm that the art treasures
mentioned were actually confiscated; and it is clear to me that
in case of a German victory they would not have remained in
Poland, but would have been used to complement German art
collections.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask you now: Is it correct that the Governor General from the
very beginning considered all art treasures which had been safeguarded
the property of the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Insofar as they were state property, yes; insofar as
they were private property, they were temporarily confiscated and
safeguarded; but the Governor General never thought of transferring
them to the Reich. If he had wanted to do that, he could have taken
advantage of the war situation itself in order to send these art
treasures to Germany. But where the witness obtained his information,
as contained in the last sentence of his affidavit, I do not
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution submitted a document, L-37, under
Exhibit Number USA-506. It is a letter of 19 July 1944 from the
commander of the Security Police and SD of the district of Radom,
to the branch office of Tomassov. There it says, among other things,
and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Higher SS and Police Leader East issued the following
order on 28 June 1944:”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip a few sentences and then quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reichsführer SS, with the approval of the Governor
General, has ordered that in all cases where assassinations of
Germans or attempts at such assassinations have occurred, or
where saboteurs have destroyed vital installations, not only
the perpetrators are to be shot but also all their kinsmen are
likewise to be executed and their female relatives above
16 years of age are to be put into concentration camps.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is it known to you whether the Governor General ever spoke
about this question with the Reichsführer SS and whether he had
given any such approval?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I know nothing about the issuing of an order of that
kind. Once during the second half of 1944, an order came through
my hands relating to the joint responsibility of kin, but I cannot say
whether that concerned the Reich or the Government General; it
was a police order, I should say. If it had had that formula, “with
the approval of the Government General,” I should have questioned
the Governor General on that point.
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Would such an approval have been consistent with
the fundamental attitude of the Governor General to this question
as you knew it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The fundamental attitude of the Governor General
was on the contrary opposed to all executions without trial and
without legal reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that from 1940 on the Governor General
complained continually to the Führer about the measures taken by
the Police and the SD?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes; I myself drew up at least half a dozen memoranda
of about the length of the one submitted, addressed to the
Führer direct or to him through the Chief of the Reich Chancellery.
They contained repeated complaints with regard to executions, encroachments
in connection with the recruiting of workers, the
importation of inhabitants of other regions without the permission
of the Governor General, the food situation, and happenings in
general which were contrary to the principles of an orderly
administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution submitted one of these memoranda
under the number USA-610. This is a memorandum to the Führer
of 19 June 1943. Is this memorandum essentially different to any
previous or later memoranda; and what, basically, was the attitude
of the Führer to such complaints and proposals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: This memorandum, which has been submitted, is somewhat
different from the previous ones. The previous memoranda
contained direct accusations with regard to these happenings and
the encroachments by the Police. When these memoranda remained
unsuccessful, acting on the order of the Governor General, I drew
up the complaints contained in this memorandum of June in the
form of a political proposal. The grievances listed there were not
caused by the government of the Governor General; rather they
were complaints about interference by outside authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In the diary we find on 26 October 1943 a long report
about the 4 years of German construction work in the Government
General which was made by you yourself. On the basis of what
documents did you compile that report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I compiled that report on the basis of the material
which the 13 main departments of the government had given me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Now a question of principle: What, basically, was the
attitude of the Governor General to the Polish and Ukrainian
people, as you know it from your 5 years’ activity, as the head of
the government?
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The first principle of all was that of keeping peace in
this area and of increasing the usefulness of this area as far as
possible by improving its resources, economically speaking. In order
to achieve that, decent treatment of the population was necessary;
freedom and property must not be infringed upon. Those were the
principles of policy according to which, acting on the order of the
Governor General, I always carried out my functions as state secretary
of the government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that the Governor General also tried
within the framework of wartime conditions to grant the population
a certain minimum of cultural development?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That was the desire of the Governor General, but the
realization of this desire very frequently met with resistance on the
part of the Security Police, or the Propaganda Ministry of the Reich,
or it was made impossible by conditions themselves. But in principle
the Governor General did not wish to prohibit cultural activity
among the Polish and Ukrainian populations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that he tried particularly to revive
higher education and that, evading the directives from the Reich,
he instituted so-called technical courses in colleges?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Instruction was certainly given at the technical schools
by Polish professors in Warsaw and Lvov which corresponded
approximately to a university education. As a matter of principle,
the Governor General also wanted to open secondary schools and
seminaries for priests, but that always failed because of the objections
of the Security Police. As no agreement could be reached, and
acting on the order of the Governor General, in October 1941 on
my own authority I promised the opening of secondary schools and,
I believe, of seminaries for priests with a certain advisory autonomy
for the Poles. Two days after this announcement the Führer’s
opinion was transmitted to me that I had no authority to announce
such measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Dr. Frank’s diary often mentions the principle of
unity of administration and the fact that the Governor General was
the deputy of the Führer in this territory and the representative of
the authority of the Reich. Does this conception tally with the facts?
What other authorities of the Reich and the Party came into the
administration of the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The authority of the Governor General was limited
from the very beginning in many important respects. Thus, for
instance, before the establishment of the Government General, the
Reichsführer SS had been invested with full power in the matter of
the preservation of German Nationality in all occupied territories.
The Delegate for the Four Year Plan had equal authority and power
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
to issue decrees, in the Government General. But many other offices
as well, such as those for armaments, post, railways, building, and
other departments tried, and tried successfully, to take over parts of
the administration of the Government General or to gain some
influence over it. After the Governor General had lost his offices as
Reichsleiter in 1942, there was a special rush in this direction. I
might almost say that it became a kind of sport to diminish the
prestige of the King of Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Who appointed, dismissed, and paid the police
officials in the Government General and otherwise saw to their
interests from the point of view of the Civil Service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That was done exclusively by Himmler’s administrative
office in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that even officials of the administration
of the Government General were arrested by Krüger and that it
was not possible for even the Governor General to effect their
release? I remind you of the case of Scipessi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes. I can confirm that from my own experience.
Even from my own circle people were arrested without my being
notified. In one such case I instructed the commander of the Security
Police that the official was to be released within a certain space of
time. He was not released, and I demanded the recall of the commander
of the Security Police. The result was that Himmler expressed
his special confidence in this commander of the Security
Police and the recall was refused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, how long was the Government General able
to work at all under normal conditions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I might almost say, never at any time. The first year
was taken up in repairing destruction caused by the war. There
were destroyed villages, destroyed cities, destroyed means of transport;
bridges had been blown up in very large numbers. After these
destroyed objects had been repaired, as far as it was possible under
war conditions, the Government General became again the deployment
area for the war against the East, against the Russians, and
then the transit area to the front and the line of communications
area. It was the great repair shop for the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Another question: During the war Himmler presented
to the Reich Government the draft of a law concerning the treatment
of anti-social elements. What was the attitude of Dr. Frank
towards this draft?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: As far as I can remember...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, the Tribunal thinks that the matters
which the witness is going into are really matters of common
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
knowledge. Everyone knows about that. I think you might take the
witness over this ground a little bit faster than you are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, Sir. He has given the answer already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, during the war did the government of the Reich...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But I am speaking of the future, Dr. Seidl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] During the war, Himmler submitted to
the Reich Government, the draft of a law concerning the treatment
of anti-social elements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What was the attitude of the Governor General
to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Governor General protested against this. At the
conference which I had with Heydrich in February 1942 the latter
asked me as a special request to ask the Governor General to retract
his protect against the law. The Governor General refused to do this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution has presented a chart which shows
Dr. Frank as having authority over the Reich Minister of Justice,
Dr. Thierack. Did such a situation ever exist?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That must be an error; such a situation never existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What, according to your observations, were the
relations between the Governor General and the Reichsführer SS
Himmler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Governor General and the Reichsführer SS
Himmler as individuals were so different...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, I thought we had been hearing all
morning what the relations were between the Governor General
and the Reichsführer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I will not put that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, the Soviet Prosecution, under Exhibit Number USSR-93,
(Document Number USSR-93), submitted an appendix to the report
of the Polish Government. The appendix is entitled “Cultural Life
in Poland.” I have shown it to you once before and would like you
to tell me whether the Governor General, or his government, ever
actually issued such directives?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not remember ever having signed such directives
or having seen any such directives signed by the Governor General.
This document submitted to me, seems to me to be a fake or a
forgery. That can be recognized from the contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In the diary we find a large number of entries
referring to the policies of the Governor General which seem to
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
contradict what you yourself said before as a witness. How can you
explain these contradictions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: These statements by the Governor General, which have
also been called to my attention during previous interrogations, do
not merely seem to contradict what I said; they very clearly do
contradict what I had to say as a witness. As I myself heard such
statements frequently, I have tried to understand how he came to
make such statements; and I can only say that Frank perhaps took
part more than was necessary in the conferences and affairs of the
government officials. There was scarcely a conference in which he
did not take part. Thus it happened that he had to speak many
times during one day, and I might say that in 99 out of 100 cases he
spoke on the spur of the moment, without due reflection, and I
frequently witnessed how after making such grotesque statements
he would try in the next sentences, or at the next opportunity, to
retract them and straighten them out. I also witnessed how he
rescinded authority which he had delegated on the spur of the
moment. I am sure that if I could go through the diary for every
one of these statements, I would be able to give you a dozen—dozens
of other statements to the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Frank’s diary includes...</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I should like to say the following: When the Governor
General was working with the members of his administration, he
never made such statements; at least I cannot remember any. Those
statements were always made when the Higher SS and Police Leader
was sitting next to him, so that I had the impression that he was
not free at such moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The diary of the Defendant Dr. Frank covers about
10,000 to 12,000 typewritten pages. Who kept this diary—he himself
or somebody else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: According to my observations, the diary was kept by
stenographers. At first by one stenographer, Dr. Meidinger, later by
two stenographers, Nauk and Mohr. The procedure was that these
stenographers were in the room during conferences and took notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct that to a certain extent these stenographers
received reports from a third person as to what was said
at a conference?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I often noticed that these stenographers did not take
the trouble to record everything literally, but merely wrote summaries
of the sense. I was also sometimes asked what this or that
person, or what the Governor General, had said or thought in some
particular instance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Did the Governor General see these entries in the
diary or read them later?
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: From what I know of the Governor General I do not
believe that he read them over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How can this witness tell whether he read
the notes later?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, the witness, Dr. Bühler, was the
Governor General’s closest collaborator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you wanted to put that sort of question,
you should have asked the Defendant Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: A further question, Witness. According to your
observations what caused the Governor General not to destroy that
diary, but to hand it over when he was arrested?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: On 15 March for the last time I was...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That, again is a matter which rests in the
mind of Dr. Frank, not of this witness, why he did not destroy it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: He has answered the question already, and I forego
the answer of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Now, one last question. In 1942, after
the speeches made by Dr. Frank, he was deprived of all his Party
offices. What effect did that have on his position as Governor
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I have already referred to that. It weakened his
authority considerably, and the administration in the Government
General became increasingly difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Is it correct, that the Governor General repeatedly,
both in writing and orally, tendered his resignation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, written applications for resignation I often
worded myself; and I know that he also asked orally many times
to be permitted to resign, but that this was never approved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no more questions for the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any other defendants’ counsel wish to ask
any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ROBERT SERVATIUS (Counsel for Defendant Sauckel):
Witness, is it correct that by far the largest number of the Polish
workers who came to Germany, came into the Reich before April
1942, that is, before Sauckel came into office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I cannot make any definite statement about that, but
I know that the recruitment of labor produced smaller and smaller
results and that the main quotas were probably delivered during
the first years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Were the labor quotas which had been demanded
from the Governor General reduced by Sauckel in view of
the fact that so many Poles were already working in the Reich?
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I know of one such case; Sauckel’s deputy, President
Struve, talked to me about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Is it true that Himmler for his own purposes
recruited workers from the Polish area, without Sauckel’s knowledge
and without observing the conditions which Sauckel had laid
down?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I assume that that happened. Whenever I was told
about roundups of workers, I tried to clear matters up. The Police
always said, “That is the labor administration,” and the labor administration
said, “That is the Police.” But I know that once, on a visit
to Warsaw, Himmler was very annoyed at the loafers standing at
the street corners; and I consider it quite possible that these labor
raids in Warsaw were carried out arbitrarily by the Police without
the participation of the labor administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Do you know Sauckel’s directives with regard
to the carrying out of labor recruitment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I have not seen them in detail, and I don’t remember
them. I know only that Sauckel stated, on the occasion of a visit in
Kraków, that he had not ordered the use of violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Was that a speech of Sauckel’s?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No, it was a conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Do you recall an address which Sauckel made
in Kraków to the various authorities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: He spoke as a Party speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Did he make any statements there about the
treatment of workers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: These statements were made at a conference which
preceded the visit to the Governor General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: And what was the nature of his remarks?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: My people had told him and his people that there had
been encroachments, and he answered that he had not ordered the
use of violence and denied that these events—the arrest of people in
motion picture houses or other places of assembly—had ever been
ordered or decreed by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Do you know the structure of the labor administration
in the Government General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Labor Department was part of my field of
authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Did Sauckel have any immediate influence on
the carrying out of labor recruitment?
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Not only did he have influence, but he also sent a
deputy who was not under my authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Was it possible for that deputy to carry out
the recruitment of labor direct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: If he wanted to, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: In what manner? Could he give any instructions,
or direct orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The recruiting units set up by Sauckel were not under
my authority. I tried on several occasions to get these people within
my organization, but these attempts were always countered with
the argument that these recruiting units had to be used in all the
occupied territories and that they could not be attached to one particular
area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, Sauckel’s deputy in the Government General,
President Struve, who was also in charge of the Labor Department,
was on the one hand dependent on Sauckel’s directives and did not
need to pay attention to me but was also on the other hand responsible
to me to the extent that he acted as president of the Labor
Department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: What branches handled forced recruitment
whenever that became necessary? Could the recruiting units
do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not know. The deputy always denied the fact of
forced recruitment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: I have no more questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel wish to
ask questions? Does the Prosecution desire to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, I should like to define
your official position more accurately. As from 1940 and until the
moment of the liberation of Poland you were Frank’s chief deputy,
were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: From the end of September until November 1939 I
served the Governor General in a leading position on his labor
staff. In November 1939 I became Chief of the Department of the
Governor General; that was the central administrative office of the
Governor General, in Kraków. During the second half of the year
1940 the designation of this function was changed to “State Secretary
of the Government,” and I was State Secretary of the Government
until I left Kraków on 18 January 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently you were the
chief deputy of the Defendant Hans Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: My field of activity was definitely limited. I had to
direct the administrative matters. Neither the Police, nor the Party,
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
nor the Wehrmacht, nor the various Reich offices which were directly
active in the area of the Government General, were under my
authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: When Frank was away, who
was then his deputy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The deputy of the Governor General was Seyss-Inquart,
Reich Minister Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And after Seyss-Inquart left?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: After the departure of Seyss-Inquart there was a
gap. I cannot recall the month, but I think it was in 1941 that I
was assigned as deputy of the Governor General. But that appointment
was approved only with certain modifications. I was supposed
to represent the Governor General only when he was neither
present in the area nor...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Answer me briefly. When
Frank was away, did you carry out his duties?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I answer as my conscience dictates. Whenever Frank
was not present within the area, and could not be reached outside
the area, then I was supposed to represent him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I understand. That means that
you took over when he was away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, whenever he could not be reached outside of the
area either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, yes. That is precisely what
I am asking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like the witness to be shown the typed transcript of the
report on a conference of 25 January. Will you show him, first of
all, the list of those who were present. The Tribunal will find the
passage that I desire to quote...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What year? You said the 25th of January.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: 1943, Mr. President. Your Honors
will find it on Page 7, Exhibit Number USSR-223, (Document Number
USSR-223), Paragraph 6.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, is that your signature among the list of those present?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: My signature, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That means you were present
at that conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: 1943, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I shall quote three sentences
from the typed transcript of the report. Please hand the original
to the witness.
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote three sentences from this document. It is Dr. Frank’s
speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I should like to emphasize one thing. We must not be too
soft-hearted when we hear that 17,000 have been shot. These
persons who have been shot are also victims of the war....
Let us now remember that all of us who are meeting together
here figure in Mr. Roosevelt’s list of war criminals. I have the
honor of being Number 1. We have thus, so to speak, become
accomplices in terms of world history”.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Your name is second on the list of those present at the conference.
Do you not consider that Frank must have had sufficient
grounds to number you among the most active of his accomplices
in crime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: About such statements of the Governor General I have
already said all that is necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then you ascribe this to the
Governor General’s temperament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, that is not an answer to the question.
The question was, do you consider yourself to be one of those
criminals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not consider myself a criminal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: If you do not consider yourself
a war criminal, will you perhaps recollect who personally—I
emphasize the word “personally”—actively participated in one of
Frank’s most cruel orders with regard to the Polish population? I
am talking about the decree of 2 October 1942. Were you not one
of the participants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Which measures? Which decree? I should like to be
shown it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am talking about the decree
signed 2 October and published 9 October 1943, Exhibit Number
USSR 335, (Document Number USSR-335), the decree about the
creation of the so-called courts-martial conducted by the Secret
Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The draft of this decree did not come from my office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Does this mean that you deny
participation in rendering that cruel decree effective?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, the decree comes from the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The passage I should like to
quote, Mr. President, is on Page 35, of our document book, and in
Paragraph 4 of the English translation.
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Did you not, together with Dr. Weh,
at a time when even Frank was undecided about signing, succeed
in persuading him to do so and bring into force a decree of a frankly
terrorist nature to legalize tyranny by the Police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote Page 142 of the minutes on the conference with State
Secretary Dr. Bühler (he evidently means you) and with Dr. Weh,
concerning the order issued by Dr. Weh for combating attacks on
the German work of reconstruction in the Government General:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After some brief statements by the State Secretary Dr. Bühler
and Dr. Weh, the Governor General withdraws his objections
and signs the drafted decree.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Was it not you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I request the interpreter to repeat the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am asking you: Was it you
who persuaded Frank to sign that decree as quickly as possible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Does that mean that the entry
is false?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In that case, how am I to understand
you, if this is “no” and the other is “no”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I can explain that to you exactly. The draft for this
decree had been submitted to the Governor General by SS Oberführer
Bierkamp who had recently been assigned to the Government
General. The Governor General...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [Interposing] He is in the middle of his
answer. You must let the man answer. What were you saying?
You were saying the draft had been made by somebody?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: This draft had been submitted to the Governor General
by Bierkamp who had just recently come to the Government General.
The Governor General returned this draft and had it revised in the
legislative department. When it was presented to the Governor
General, the Governor General’s doubts were whether the legislative
department had revised it or not. I do not assume material responsibility
for this draft, and I did not have to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You simply explained to Frank
that the project of the decree had been sufficiently worked over by
the competent technical department?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, by the legislative department.
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And after that the Governor
General signed the decree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Obviously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you not the person who,
at the meeting of 23 October 1943, when a letter from Count
Ronikier, a person evidently known to you, was discussed, referred
to the practical interpretation of this cruel decree of 2 October and
stated that the application of the decree would in the future favor
the camouflaging of the murder of hostages by giving the shootings
of hostages the semblance of a legal sentence? Were you that person?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I ask that the question be repeated. I understood only
part of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you the person who, at
the meeting of 23 October 1943, stated that the application of the
decree of 2 October would, in the future, favor the camouflaging
of the shooting of hostages, since it would give them the semblance
of a legal sentence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It is not quite clear to me. May I repeat what I understood?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: If you please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: You want to ask me whether I was the one who, on
the occasion of a conference on the 23rd of October 1944...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: 1943—who, on the occasion of a conference on 23 October
1943 stated—stated what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You stated that the application
of the decree of 2 October would help to camouflage the shooting of
hostages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The place which I wish to quote
now, Your Honors, is on Page 26 of the English translation of Exhibit
Number USSR-223, (Document Number 2233-PS), Paragraph 4. I
shall now quote your own words to you:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“State Secretary Dr. Bühler considers it advisable that all
those Poles who are to be shot should first be tried by regular
court-martial proceedings. In the future one should also
refrain from referring to such Poles as hostages, for the
shooting of hostages is always a deplorable event and merely
provides foreign countries with evidence against the German
leadership in the Government General”.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I said that, and thus I objected, and wanted to object,
to the shooting of hostages and to executions without court-martial
proceedings.
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you consider that a court
consisting of high-ranking, police officials represents justice and is
not a travesty of the very idea of justice?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: To which court do you refer? I pleaded for courts-martial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is the very court I am
talking about, the “Standgericht” or summary court-martial, composed
of Gestapo officials centralized in the Government General,
according to the decree of 2 October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I can give you information about the reasons which
may have led to this stiffening of the summary court-martial order
of 2 October, so that you may understand how, psychologically, such
a decree came about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR. SMIRNOV: I am not interested in psychology.
I am interested in knowing if a court, composed of secret
police officials and considered to be a court, is not in fact sheer
mockery of the very idea of a court of justice?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The summary courts-martial had to be appointed
exactly in accordance with the decree. I am not of the opinion that
a summary court-martial, simply because it is composed exclusively
of police, should not be considered a court. But I did not make
these statements which you have held against me now in reference
to this decree of 2 October; rather I demanded, in general, sentences
by courts-martial, and termed the shooting of hostages
a regrettable fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You are not giving me a direct
answer to my question. Perhaps you will remember Paragraph 3
of the decree which stipulates how these courts were to be composed.
Show the witness Paragraphs 3 and 4. I am reading Paragraph
4 into the record:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The summary courts-martial of the Security Police are to
be composed of one SS Führer of the office of the commander
of the Security Police and the SD, and of two
members of these organizations”.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Would a court of this composition not testify <span class='it'>a priori</span> to the
nature of the sentence which the court would impose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Did you ask me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Whether I consider a summary court-martial a court?
I think, you are asking me about things which have nothing to do
with my field of activity. I do not know what reasons were given
for composing these courts in this fashion. I cannot therefore say
anything about it.
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps you will look at the
signature to that decree. It is signed by Frank, and it was you who
persuaded Frank to sign that decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I thought that I had corrected that error before. I
did not persuade Herr Frank to sign that order. Rather, I told him
that that order had been worked out in the legislative department.
As before, I must now deny any responsibility for this order, because
it did not belong to my sphere of activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I shall pass on to another series
of questions. Do you recollect the following subparagraph of that
decree, particularly the report of Obergruppenführer Bierkamp at
the conference of 27 October 1943 in Kraków?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I cannot remember without notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please show him the passage
which I wish to quote. The passage I wish to quote, Your Honors,
is on Page 26 of our document, the last paragraph of the text. I
quote the passage in question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Pursuant to the decree of even date, the Security Police have
detained many people who since 10 October have committed
criminal acts. They have been condemned to death and will
be shot as an expiation for their crimes. Their names will be
made known to the population by means of posters, and the
population will be told that such and such people may expect
a pardon, provided there are no further murders of Germans.
For every murdered German, 10 Poles will be executed....”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Does it not testify to the fact that from the very first days of
the enforcing of Frank’s decree, it merely served to mask mass
executions of hostages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then to what does it testify if,
for each slain German, 10 Poles entirely unconnected with the
crime were to be executed in accordance with these so-called
“verdicts”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: In my opinion it testifies that 10 Poles would be shot
who had committed crimes punishable by death, and who had been
sentenced to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: For each German killed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It is possible that these Poles were called hostages.
That is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That means that the decree
camouflaged the system of taking hostages?
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No, it was rather that real shootings of hostages no
longer occurred. Real shootings of hostages occur when people
who are not criminals, who are innocent, are shot because of an act
committed by someone else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think this will be a convenient time
to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has heard with the deepest
regret of the death of Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone of the Supreme
Court of the United States of America. His loss will be most deeply
felt in America, where he had proved himself to be a great public
servant. But it is fitting that this Tribunal, upon which the representatives
of the United States sit, should express its sympathy
with the American people in their great loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After serving as Dean of the Law School of Columbia University
he was appointed Attorney General of the United States in 1923,
and two years later he became Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. In 1941 he became Chief Justice and discharged the duties
of that high office with great ability and in accordance with the
highest traditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal desires that I should express its sympathy in
acknowledgement of the great loss the American people have
sustained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Justice Jackson, the Chief Prosecutor of the United States,
is a member of the Supreme Court over which the Chief Justice
presided, and perhaps he would like to add a few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE ROBERT H. JACKSON (Chief of Counsel for the
United States): May it please the Tribunal: It is not only because
he was the head of the judicial system of the United States that
the news of the passing of Chief Justice Stone brings sadness to
every American heart in Nuremberg, but because he was the personal
friend of so many of us. He had a rare capacity for personal friendship.
No one was more kind to, and thoughtful of, the younger
men who from time to time came to Washington; and they found
in him a guide, philosopher, and friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I know that not only do I feel the loss of a personal friend
but that the American representatives on the Tribunal, Mr. Biddle
and Judge Parker, feel the same way, and many of the younger
men on the staff had intimate contact with the Chief Justice which
you might not expect if you had not known Harlan Stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Attorney General he took over the Department of Justice
at one of its most difficult periods and imparted to it the impress
of his integrity, an impress which stayed with it and was traditional
in the department, as we well know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a Justice of the Court he was a forward-looking man, open-minded,
always patient to hear the arguments of both sides and to
arrive at his decision with that complete disinterestedness and
detachment which is characteristic of the just judge. He presided
with great fairness and with kindness to his associates and to those
who appeared before him.
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the passing of a man who exemplified in public life those
sturdy qualities which we have come to associate with the New
Englander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consolation of his friends lies in this: He died exactly as he
would have chosen to die, in full possession of his faculties and in
the discharge of his duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I express great appreciation that this Tribunal has seen fit to
take note of his passing and to allow us to record on behalf of the
American Bar our appreciation of his talents and character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, before proceeding
to a further examination of the witness, I feel that I ought
to make the following statement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the examination of the witness by counsel for the defense
Dr. Seidl, the former stated that the document, which is an official
appendix to the report of the Government of the Polish Republic,
was a forgery. This document sets out the losses suffered by the
Polish Republic in objects of cultural value. The Soviet Prosecution
does not wish to enter into any controversies on the subject, but
it does request the Tribunal to note that this is an official appendix
to the report of the Government of the Polish Republic, and that it
considers the statement of the witness as libellous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To the witness.</span>] Did you say anything then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I was going to say that it was a document that
contained a list of art treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the document, Colonel Smirnov, a
document which contains a list of art treasures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No, I do not mean that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, Mr. President. It is a list
of losses in cultural treasures. It is a list of libraries and of the
losses suffered by these libraries during the reign of the Germans
in Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is USSR-93, is it not, the document you
are referring to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: It is an appendix to the Document
Number USSR-93, an official report by the Polish Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, it deals with certain directives. That
was the evidence that was given this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, Mr. President. This is a list
of losses sustained. It is an official appendix to the report of the
Polish Government. It contains no directives, but it does state the
sum total of the losses sustained by the public libraries in Poland.
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To the witness.</span>] Is there anything you want
to say about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes. I do not think the description just given applies
to the document which I had in mind. The document which I
question contains directives regarding German cultural policy in
the Government General. It does not deal with art treasures or

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. What I took that you said this morning
was that the directives which you thought were referred to in the
document did not appear to have been made, or at any rate you had
not heard of them, and you thought they might be forgeries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I questioned the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will consider the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I proceed to the next
question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You state that you personally,
as well as the administration of the Government General, had no
close connection with the activities of the Police. Have I understood
you correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: May I hear that question again, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You declare that neither you
personally nor the administration of the Government General were
in any way closely connected with the activities of the Police. Have
I understood you correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: We had daily contact with the Police, but we had
differences of opinion. Moreover, the Police were not under my
jurisdiction; the Chief of Police was in no way under my orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In that case the Police did
not come within your competence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No, it was not one of my duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How then can you explain that
no one but you carried out successful negotiations with the Police
for the exploitation of the property of Jews executed in the concentration
camps? Do you remember these negotiations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I did not quite understand you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I ask you: If you had no direct
relations with the Police, how can you explain the fact that you,
and none other but you, were the person who carried out successful
negotiations with the Police for the exploitation of property belonging
to Jews murdered in the concentration camps? Do you remember
these negotiations with the Police?
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not remember any such negotiations, and I could
not have conducted them. In any case the Administration was the
department which, by order of the Four Year Plan, had to effect
the confiscation of Jewish property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, have I your permission
to submit a document handed to us by the American
Prosecution, Document Number 2819-PS? It is a directive issued
by the Administration of the Economic Department of the Government
General and addressed to the Governors of Warsaw, Radom,
Lublin, and Galicia. May I submit this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote the following from the text of this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Subject: Transfer of Jewish movable property from the SS
to the Government.</p>

<p>“I inform you herewith that, on 21 February 1944, in the
presence of various departmental directors, an agreement was
reached by State Secretary Dr. Bühler and the Higher SS and
Police Leader, Obergruppenführer Koppe, that movable
Jewish property, insofar as it is, or will be in the future, in
storehouses, will be placed at the disposal of the Government
by the SS. In execution of the agreement arrived at I have
ordered that the taking over of the goods stored in the various
SS depots shall take place in the shortest possible time. Goods
deriving from confiscation and safeguarding have likewise
been turned over to me by the commander of the Security
Police and the Security Service. Please get in touch with
the local SS and Police Leader in order to come to an understanding....”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here I interrupt the quotation. After this, Witness, do you still
insist that you had no relations with the Police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I was in touch with the Police daily in my work, I
do not want to deny that for a moment; but I had no right to give
orders to the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In any case the property of
Jews murdered in the concentration camps of Poland was, as a
result of your negotiations, transferred to warehouses in the Government
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That is not correct. The property mentioned was
not that which proceeded from Jews who were killed, but simply
property which came from Jews and which was removed by the
Police after having been converted through the administration
department in the regular way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But could the Security Police or
the SD be in possession of property belonging to Jews who were
not murdered?
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Why not? Right from the beginning the Police had
taken over Jewish problems, and therefore also came into possession
of their property in this manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But did the Auschwitz depot
in Chopin Street also keep the property of Jews who had not been
murdered? Of Jews who were still alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The depots which have been mentioned here are not
to be interpreted as being concentration camps, but as depots where
goods were stored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What other depots were there
for storing the movable property of Jews besides those in the
concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not know what things looked like in concentration
camps, as I have never entered or seen one; but that the
Police took possession of movable Jewish property is something I
was certainly told about by the director of my trustee department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I ask you this: In 1944 when
the machines of destruction were working at top speed at Auschwitz
and Maidanek, what depots or warehouses existed for the storage
of Jewish movable property besides those which stored the movable
property of Jews executed in concentration camps? Do you know
of any other warehouses and where they were located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Jews were deprived of their property on the
spot. I have never assumed that Jewish property was to be found
in concentration camps. I did not know anything at all about these
camps. Where the Police took that movable property was not clear
to me, but depots must have existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would draw your attention
to the date—21 February 1944. At that time were there any Jews
still alive in Poland, or were the Jewish ghettos already quite empty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Jewish ghettos were empty, but there were still
some Jews; I know that because they were being used in one way
or another in the armament industry. Jewish property could not
have been removed from the territory, it must have been somewhere
in the Government General, very probably near the ghettos
or wherever else the evacuation of Jews took place. And this
telegram, I repeat, does not concern stores which were in concentration
camps; they were everywhere. Every place had property
stored somewhere which originated from the resettlement of the
Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then the Jewish ghettos were
already empty. In that case, what happened to the Jews from
Poland?
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: When these Jewish ghettos were emptied, I assumed
they were resettled in the northeast of Europe. The chief of the
RSHA had definitely told me at the conference in February 1942
that this was the intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: On the 21 February 1944 the
front line ran through the Government General. How and where
could the Jews have been transferred to the northeast?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: According to the conference this was to have taken
place in 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The document is dated 1944,
21 February 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass on to the next question. Tell me, does not the fact that
the police chiefs attended all the conferences at the headquarters
of the Governor General and that the Governor General arranged
for special conferences to be held dealing exclusively with police
matters indicate that the very closest relations existed between the
administration department of the Governor General and the Gestapo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I have already mentioned at the beginning that the
view of the Governor General was that he should have jurisdiction
over the Police. This is the reason why the Governor General
repeatedly called the Police for discussions around the conference
table. But that did not prevent the Police from going their own
way and using methods of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But were no conferences held
by the Governor General for dealing directly and exclusively with
police problems, and with police problems only?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, from time to time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well. Then will you tell
me who took Krüger’s place when he was removed from his post
as Chief of Police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: As far as I can remember Krüger was removed from
his post in Kraków in November 1943 and was replaced by Obergruppenführer
Koppe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What were your personal relations
with Koppe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The relationship with the Police under Krüger had
always been hostile, and whenever the administration department
had any wish that involved police jurisdiction, such wishes had
always been frustrated by Krüger; therefore, after Krüger had
left Kraków I tried to establish a comradely relationship with the
new Higher SS and Police Leader, so that in this manner I could
influence the work of the Police and the methods employed by them.
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Could you answer briefly: What
exactly were your personal relations with Koppe? Were they good
or bad?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: They were comradely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like to show you one
document. You, Mr. President, will find the passage on Page 38,
Paragraph 2, of the English translation. I am reading the passage
into the record. It is a statement made by Frank to Himmler at
the conference with Himmler on the 12 February 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Immediately after the exchange of greetings, Reichsführer SS
Himmler entered into conversation with me and SS Obergruppenführer
Koppe. The Reichsführer asked me right at
the beginning how I was co-operating with the new Secretary
of State for Security, SS Obergruppenführer Koppe. I
expressed my deep satisfaction at the fact that between
myself and SS Obergruppenführer Koppe, as well as between
him and State Secretary Dr. Bühler, there existed extraordinarily
good relations of friendly co-operation.” (Document
Number 2233-PS.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Does that statement by Frank correspond to the fact, Witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: At that time Koppe had been in the Government
General only a few weeks. This statement confirms just what I
said here at the beginning, namely, that after Krüger had been
replaced by Koppe I tried through comradely relations with Koppe
to gain influence over the police powers in the Government General.
Thus there had been no friction up to that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And between Koppe and
Dr. Bühler, that is, between Koppe and yourself, there existed the
most comradely collaboration; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I repeat, my relations with Koppe were comradely.
Apart from that, the problems with which we had to deal brought
me into daily contact with Koppe. For instance, there was this
question of Jewish property. One could not possibly have discussed
such a question with Krüger, as he held the view that all Jewish
property belonged to the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: When Koppe took over the post
of Chief of Police, was there any change with regard to the Polish
population? Did the police measures become less severe? Did they
become less repressive with Koppe’s arrival?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I believe they were milder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to follow the
minutes of one particular administrative conference of the 16 December
1943, held at Kraków.
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Please show the witness the original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incidentally, is that your signature on the list of those present?
On Page 154.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Government meeting, 16 December 1943? Yes, I signed
that; that is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me, do you remember who
Ohlenbusch was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Ohlenbusch was the President of the Department of
Propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was he in any way connected
with the Police or with the administration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Ohlenbusch participated in the government meetings,
at which the Police were also present as a rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But he himself, in his own
function, did he have any connection with the Police or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: As a state official and head of a government department
he did, of course, have connections with the Police, official
connections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But he was an official of the
civilian administration of your organization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, of course. As far as his official position was
concerned, he was subordinate to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am reading into the record
a short extract from Page 176. Your Honors will find it on Page 33
of our document book, Paragraph 3, Ohlenbusch’s speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It would be well to consider whether, for reasons of
expediency, one should not, as far as possible, carry out
executions on the spot where the attempt upon the life of a
German took place. One ought, perhaps, also to consider
whether special execution sites should not be created for this
purpose, for it has been confirmed that the Polish population
streamed to the execution grounds, which were accessible
to all, in order to put the blood-soaked earth into containers
and take them to the church.” (Document Number 2233-PS.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you not consider this question a purely police question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It does not mention buckets of blood in my translation.
It says containers. I do not think that the blood could be carried
away in buckets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: We are talking here about
containers into which the blood-soaked soil was placed. Do you
not consider that the question of organizing secret execution grounds
was purely a matter for the Police?
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I am of the same opinion. For this reason this matter
was by no means approved of. But perhaps I may add that at the same
time German pedestrians in Kraków and Warsaw were being shot
in the back daily, without any reason, and that this affair was due
to the excitement which...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am asking you about something
else, Witness. Do you not consider the fact that this question was
discussed at the initiative of Ohlenbusch as positive proof that even
the petty officials in the civilian administration interfered in police
matters and were in direct contact with the Police?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No, I would not say so. This was not suggested as a
police measure. It arose from the threat under which all Germans
lived at that stage of the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This question of secret execution
grounds—did it arise on Ohlenbusch’s initiative? I trust you are
not going to deny this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: What do you mean by this question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did it arise on—was it provoked
by the initiative of Ohlenbusch? You are not going to deny it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not know whether this was discussed at all. In
my opinion there was not...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The typewritten report of that
conference is before you, and you were present at that conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, there are statements made by Ohlenbusch, if I
am not mistaken. Yes, it mentions “President Ohlenbusch” here.
That is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I shall proceed to the next
question. Did SS Obergruppenführer Koppe not report on the
subject at all during the conference? I will quote a brief excerpt
which Your Honors will find on Page 34, Paragraph 2. It is on
Page 180 of your document book.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...For the railway outrage 150 and for the two German
officials, 50 Polish terrorists were executed either on the spot
or in the immediate vicinity. It must be remembered that
the shooting of 200 people affects at least 3,000 (nearest
relatives)...” (Document Number 2288-PS.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you not consider this as evidence that with the arrival of
Koppe the same savage measures of repression were used against
the people of Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Inasmuch as this mentions the shooting of 150 and 50
people this obviously concerns the shooting of hostages, which never
did have the approval of the Governor General or my approval.
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
If I have nevertheless stated that in its entirety Koppe’s regime
appeared milder to me, then I must stand by that statement of mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Does this mean that the hostage
system did not meet either with your approval or with the approval
of the Governor General; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It did not have my approval, and I do not think it
had the approval of the Governor General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please look at Page 185
of the document in your possession. I begin with the quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General expressed his gratitude and recognition
to SS Obergruppenführer Koppe for his effective work
and spoke of his satisfaction that an expert with such high
qualifications should be at the head of the police organization
in the Government General. He promised SS Obergruppenführer
Koppe the active co-operation of all offices in the
Government General and expressed his best wishes for the
success of his work.” (Document Number 2233-PS.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>How are we to interpret this statement in the light of your
previous answer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: This statement of the Governor General does not
apply to these 50 and 150 people. It applies to the work in its
entirety which was to be done by Koppe in the Government General.
And one of the principles that was to be applied to that work—which
I helped bring about—was that shootings of hostages were
to cease. It is quite possible that in this case that principle had
not yet been applied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Would you please wait one
minute. Just before this you read Koppe’s report on the shooting
of the hostages, Page 180. And after that the Governor General
expressed his approval. This means that it was precisely this activity
of Koppe’s that the Governor General had approved?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Well, this was not the only statement made by Koppe.
The statement of the Governor General was in reference to all the
statements made by Koppe, and not to detached portions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well. In that case he also
approved, among other things, of this statement, that is to say, this
report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: But I know that the Governor General, together with
me, was exerting pressure on Koppe in order to stop the shooting
of hostages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you kindly inform me who,
while Krüger was still Chief of Police, issued instructions for the
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
shooting of one male inhabitant from each house which displayed a
poster announcing a Polish national holiday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That is unknown to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I ask to have the corresponding
document submitted to you. It is in the document book, on Page 1,
Paragraph 7:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General received District Chief, Dr. Waechter,
who reported on the appearance in some districts of inflammatory
posters on the occasion of the 11 November (the Polish
Day of Liberation). The Governor General ordered that from
every house where a poster remains exhibited one male
inhabitant is to be shot. This order is to be carried out by
the Chief of Police. Dr. Waechter has taken 120 hostages in
Kraków as a precautionary measure.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember that? Who then introduced this criminal
practice of taking hostages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Are you trying to say that I was present during that
conference?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like to ask you about
something else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Please, will you answer my question? Was I there
or was I not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am not obliged to answer
your question. It is you, Witness, who have to answer mine. It is
I who am interrogating you, not you who are examining me. Kindly
answer the next question. You resided in Kraków. Acting on
Frank’s orders, Dr. Waechter, as a precautionary measure, detained
120 hostages. Do you wish to say that you knew nothing about this
either?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I know nothing about this measure; nor is it known
to me that hostages were shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the following
question. Have I understood you correctly—did you state today
that there was no famine in Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, there was no famine in Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am asking you to be shown
the speech of Dr. Bühler, State Secretary—that obviously means
you—at a meeting on the 31 May 1943, in Kraków. I begin the
quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...The Government of the Government General has for a
long time been clear on the point that the scale of food
rations allowed to non-Germans cannot be continued any
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
longer without the population taking matters into its own
hands or being driven to insurrection... The difficulties of
the food situation, which naturally have a bad effect on the
morale of the population, the enormous rise in prices, the
exaggerated and narrow-minded salary and wage policy, have
driven part of the Polish population to despair.” (Document
Number 2233-PS.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you say that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I could follow the first part, but I could not find the
last sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Would you kindly follow the
text. In the text you will find both the first part and the last
sentence: “...have driven part of the Polish population to despair.”
Please study the text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Where does it say so, please? Would you show it to me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The text was indicated to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made these statements, and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Then I also have the following
question to ask you. Do you not think that your announcement in
1943 bears witness to the fact that you have today testified falsely
before the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No; no. What I meant by my statement was that the
population would take things into its own hands. When for instance
a worker remained away from his place of work for 3 days to go
in search of food, this was considered by me to be a desperate step
on the part of the worker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, I said this morning that it was very difficult for the
population to obtain the necessary food supplies but that it was
not impossible, so that I did not notice famine at all in the Government
General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And please may I ask you to consider that 80 percent of the
population of the Government General were country people, so
that there could be no famine on a large scale unless the countryside
had been completely despoiled, and that was not the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You stated that as a result of
the food quotas established in the Government General a revolt
might arise, and you said that the population was driven to despair
by hunger. Is that not evidence that a famine was raging in the
country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: By “revolt” I meant “unrest,” not an armed uprising.
It is quite clear that morale and the will to work did suffer by
reason of the insufficient rations. I stated this morning how it was
that adequate provisioning of the population could not be carried
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
out. On the other hand, however, there was such a widespread
free market and black market that even the worker, if he had
sufficient time, could obtain food; and if he did not have time, he
took it. That was what I meant by the workers taking things in
their own hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please, answer this question.
Were only such educational possibilities left to the Poles as would—according
to the plan of Frank and Goebbels—merely emphasize
the hopeless destiny of their nation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Efforts to keep down the level of education of the
Polish population were noticeable. These tendencies originated from
Himmler in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to answer:
What was done with the Polish universities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: They were closed and they were not reopened.
However, technical courses were arranged in Warsaw and in Lvov
in which these people received university education; but, to be sure,
these courses had to be closed by demand of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps you will recollect under
whose signature the decree was issued to close the universities.
Perhaps you will recognize this signature? It is an official report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The decree regarding the appointment of university
trustees was signed by the Governor General in November 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please tell me whether
technical schools only were left in Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Not technical schools alone remained open; there were,
for instance, commercial schools, and the attendance there was very
large. Apart from that, there were craft schools and elementary
schools, which were set up on a large scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In other words, only those schools
were left which trained artisans, and petty commercial clerks and
tradesmen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Whether only petty or also more important traders
attended them I do not know. At any rate commercial schools were
permitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like to know on whose
initiative the royal palace at Warsaw was destroyed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not know for certain. I heard once that it had
been the Führer’s wish that the castle in Warsaw, which was
heavily damaged, should be razed to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And by whose personal order
was this castle, the royal castle of Warsaw destroyed?
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not know whether it was blown up; that I do
not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes. It was destroyed. Who
ordered it to be destroyed, do you know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You do not know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The quotation which I want to
read to you is on Page 1 of the translation of the document submitted
by us to the Tribunal. It is a very short quotation. I shall
proceed to read it into the record:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...The Führer discussed the general situation with the
Governor General and he approved of the work of the Governor
General in Poland, especially the pulling down of the
palace at Warsaw and the intention not to reconstruct the
city...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Was it not true that the palace in Warsaw was destroyed by
order of Frank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: It is not known to me that the castle was destroyed.
As far as I know there was at one time a project to pull it down,
but the plan was abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me, please, was it not in
your presence that the Defendant Frank on 21 April 1940 issued
an order to apply police measures during the so-called recruitment
of labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I should have to see the minutes. I cannot remember
it offhand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was handed to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The place which I should like
to quote is on Page 46 of the document, the last paragraph. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Discussion with State Secretary Dr. Bühler, SS Obergruppenführer
Krüger, and Dr. Frauendorfer in the presence of Reich
Minister Dr. Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p>“Subject of discussion is the deportation of workers, especially
agricultural workers, to the Reich.</p>

<p>“The Governor General stated that, as all methods in the
way of appeals, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, had been unsuccessful, one was
now obliged to come to the conclusion that the Poles evaded
this duty of work either out of malice, or with the intention
of doing Germany indirect harm by not placing themselves
at her disposal. He therefore asked Dr. Frauendorfer whether
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
there were any measures left which had not yet been taken
to win the Poles over voluntarily.</p>

<p>“Reichshauptamtsleiter Dr. Frauendorfer answered this
question in the negative.</p>

<p>“The Governor General stated emphatically that a final
decision was now required of him. The question now was
whether one would not have to resort to some form of
coercive measure.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Was that not an order to apply coercive measures when
recruiting labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I will not contradict the statement, as I have seen
the minutes. It is one of the utterances of the Governor General
which, I believe, were not altogether made voluntarily but which
in no way altered the course which I took on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the following
question: Were you present at a discussion with Sauckel on
18 August 1942, and was it in your presence that Frank told Sauckel
that he—as he put it—“joyfully” informed him that he had shipped
a fresh convoy of workers to the Reich with the help of the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Together with my departmental heads who dealt with
the recruitment of workers I had a conference with Reich Commissioner
Sauckel before the visit to the Governor General took place.
I cannot now remember whether I was present when Reich Commissioner
Sauckel visited the Governor General. I ask to see the
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please show the defendant, I
mean the witness, the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was handed to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will now read into the record two short passages on Pages 918
and 920. Doctor Frank says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I am very glad that I can inform you officially that up to
this date we have sent to Germany over 800,000 workers.
Only a short time ago you asked for another 140,000. I
am happy to inform you officially that, in accordance with
our agreement of yesterday, 60 percent of these newly
requested workers will be sent by the end of October, and
the other 40 percent will be dispatched to the Reich by the
end of the year.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then I will ask you to pass on to Page 120. There is only one
other sentence I want to quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Besides the 140,000, you can count on a further number of
workers from the Government General during the coming
year, for we will use the Police to get them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Does that not imply the use of Draconian police methods in
the so-called recruiting of manpower?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I do not recollect that I was present on that occasion,
so I can in no way confirm whether that was said in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no more
questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To Dr. Seidl.</span>] Do you want to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have a few more questions to ask the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, I should like to clarify a misunderstanding which
seems to have arisen. The question which I put to the witness in
connection with Document Number USSR-93 referred only to
Appendix 1, which has the title “Cultural Life in Poland.” That
appendix deals with directives regarding cultural policies which
the administration of the Government General was supposed to have
issued, and the way I understood the witness was that he only
wanted to answer that particular question and not refer to the other
appendices, such as, for instance, those dealing with confiscated art
treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it would have been better if he had not used the word
“forged.” At any rate, he wanted to say that he did not know the
directives in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, is it correct that by far the
greater number of Polish workers who were brought to the Reich
were volunteers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: May I, first of all, say that I by no means wished to
accuse the Prosecution of committing a forgery. I merely wanted to
point out that possibly they were using a forged document. I did
not want to accuse the Prosecution itself of a forgery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, regarding the question put by defense counsel, I want to
say that according to my observations by far the greater number of
all the workers from the Government General went to the Reich
voluntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: So as to assist your memory, I am going to read
a short quotation from the diary, which deals with the recruiting
of workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 March 1940 the Governor General addressed a meeting of
the town mayors of the Lublin district and stated the following
regarding the recruitment of workers:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He rejected the issue of a new decree, as demanded by
Berlin, containing particular coercive measures and threats
of punishment. Measures which attract attention abroad should
be avoided. The forcible transport of people had every argument
against it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Does that conception reflect the true views of the Governor
General?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: I was not present during that conference, so I did not
hear that utterance by the Governor General, but it does tally with
those instructions and principles which the Governor General gave
to me and which I have always resolutely observed and carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Were you present during a conference on
14 January 1944—I see you were there—it was a conference with
the State Secretary Dr. Bühler, Dr. Koppe, and several others. I
quote from it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General resolutely opposes the employment
of Police for carrying out such measures. Such a task is not
a matter for the Police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is it correct that the Governor General repeatedly opposed the
use of Police in connection with the recruiting of workers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: That was not the only occasion. The deputy of Reich
Commissioner Sauckel was often attacked by him during public
meetings when he talked about raids for recruiting workers; but
I must state that Sauckel’s deputy always declared that it was not
he who had given instructions for these raids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The first quotation which the prosecutor submitted
to you was an entry dated 25 January 1943. He asked you whether
you regarded yourself as a war criminal. I shall now put to you
another passage from that conference, at which you yourself were
present. I quote from Page 7 of that entry in the diary. The Governor
General stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“State Secretary Krüger, you know that orders of the Reichsführer
SS can be carried out by you only after you have
spoken with me. This was omitted in this instance. I express
my regret that you have carried out an order from the Reichsführer
without first informing me, in accordance with the
orders of the Führer. According to that order, instructions
of the Reichsführer SS may be carried out here in the Government
General only after I have previously given my approval.
I hope that this is the last time that that is overlooked; because
I do not want to trouble the Führer about every single case
of this kind.” (Document Number 2233-PS.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall skip a sentence and continue to quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is not possible for us to disregard Führer orders, and it is
out of the question that in the sphere of police and security
direct orders from the Reichsführer should be carried out over
the head of the man who has been appointed here by the
Führer; otherwise I should be completely superfluous.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now ask you, is it correct that there were very frequently
such disputes between the Governor General and the Higher SS
Police Leader Krüger, and that the Governor General terminated
these disputes by asking for co-operation, so that some sort of
administration could function in this territory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: Yes, that is correct, such disputes were our daily bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Prosecution has also submitted to you another
exhibit, USSR-335 (Document Number USSR-335), the Court-Martial
Decree, dated October 1943. I now ask you what the security situation
was like in the Government General then, and would it have
been at all possible at that time to control the situation with normal
criminal procedure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Doctor Seidl, has that not already been dealt
with very fully in his examination in chief?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I forego having this question answered again. Now
one last question, which refers to art treasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it correct that a portion of the art treasures which were found
in the region of Upper Silesia were taken to the last official residence
of the Governor General at Neuhaus to be safeguarded, and that
the Governor General gave you instructions to prepare a list of
these articles and send it to Reich Minister Lammers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BÜHLER: The Governor General dictated a report to Reich
Minister Lammers about the transfer of 20 of the most outstanding
art treasures from the property of the Polish State. I was present
when it was dictated and I took that report personally to State
Secretary Kritzinger in Berlin. It was stated therein that these
art treasures, so as to save them from the Russians, had been taken
from Seichau, or whatever the place is called, to Schliersee. These
art treasures were left unguarded in the official residence of the
Governor General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no further questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have now completed the examination of witnesses,
but as the document books have not yet been bound, I would like
to suggest that at some later stage, perhaps after the case of Frick,
I could submit these document books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, how many books are you presenting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: A total of five volumes, but I myself have not
received them yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has the Tribunal approved the documents
in five volumes?
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: They are almost entirely documents which have
already been submitted by the Prosecution and an agreement has
been reached with the Prosecution regarding the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, then, we need not wait now for the
document books. The document books will be considered by the
Tribunal when they are put in and then, if you have anything in
particular you want to say upon them in explanation, you may do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No doubt you will comment upon them in
your final speech. You say that they are mostly documents which
have already been put in, and therefore it would not be necessary
to make any preliminary comment upon them. You will be able
to deal with them in your final speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: But I should have liked to quote a few passages
during my submission of evidence, since this is necessary to establish
the connection, and as it would be impossible to do all that during
my final speech; but I do not think that too much time will be lost
through that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, Dr. Seidl, it would not be very
useful to the Tribunal for you to make a commentary upon the
documents at a later stage, when your witnesses have been finished
and somebody else’s—some other defendant’s—witnesses have been
interpolated; therefore, the Tribunal thinks it will be much better
and much more convenient to the Tribunal if you defer your
comments on the documents until your final speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, Dr. Seidl, as I understand, you have two books which are
before us now. Three is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: There is a total of five books. The other three do
not appear to have been bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but you say that most of the documents
in them are documents which are already in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The diary of the Defendant Dr. Frank, which
contains 42 volumes, has been submitted, but the Prosecution has
used only those parts which appeared favorable for them. In my
opinion it is, therefore, necessary that the connections should to
some extent be re-established during the submission of evidence.
Also, there are other documents in the document book which I
believe should be read, at least in extract, before this Tribunal, but
I shall, of course, limit myself to the absolutely necessary passages
when I read the documents. I should like to suggest to the Tribunal
that the matter be handled as it was in the case of the Defendant
Von Ribbentrop, so that I submit the individual documents to the
Tribunal as exhibits. There are several speeches by the Defendant
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
Frank, there are decrees and legal regulations, there are two
affidavits, and I really think that somehow an opinion with regard
to them should be given during the submission of evidence; and,
besides, individual documents will have to be given exhibit numbers.
Up to now only one document has been submitted as evidence on
behalf of the Defendant Frank, and that is the affidavit of the
witness Dr. Bühler; but I have the intention of bringing a whole
series of further documents formally to the notice of the Tribunal
and would like to postpone that only because the Tribunal has not
yet received the bound document books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When will these other books be ready,
Dr. Seidl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I was told that they would be completed by this
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How long do you think you will take in
dealing with these books?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I think that two hours will be enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, the Tribunal would like you to
deal with your documents now, and insofar as they are documents
which have already been put in evidence, unless you wish to refer
to other passages in them, they think that you need only tell us
what the documents are and put them in evidence, unless it is very
important to you to refer to any particular document. So far as
they are new documents, you will, no doubt, offer them in evidence
and make such short comments as you think necessary. But the
Tribunal hopes that you will be able to finish this afternoon. With
reference to the other books that you have, we understand that you
have all the documents in German yourself, and therefore you can
refer us to those documents now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, upon the wish of the Prosecution
and also, I believe, of the Tribunal, I have reduced the original bulk
of my document books considerably. The first five document books,
as I had had them prepared, contained more than eight hundred
pages. The new form is considerably shorter; but I have not received
the German text of the new form, so that I am not in a position
just now to give the number of pages to the Tribunal or to co-ordinate
my page numbers with the numbered pages of the translations.
If I may express a wish, it is that we should first wait until
the five document books in their new form are available, because
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
otherwise it is very likely that the numbering of the pages would
not correspond to the numbering of the individual documents as
exactly as might be desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks it best that you should
begin now with the first three volumes. We have them here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: If the Tribunal has the first three volumes, then I
will begin. I begin with Volume I. The first document on Page 1
is the decree of the Führer and Reich Chancellor, dated 12 October
1939, concerning the administration of the occupied Polish territories.
This decree defines in detail the authority of the Governor General.
In Paragraphs 5 and 6 some of the limitations to the authority of
the Governor General are included, which the witnesses Dr. Lammers
and Dr. Bühler have already pointed out. This document bears
the number 2537-PS and it will be Exhibit Frank-2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Page 3 of the document book. This document is the
decree of the Führer concerning the establishment of a State
Secretariat for Security in the Government General, dated 7 May
1942. I quote Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The State Secretary for Security serves at the same time
as deputy of the Reichsführer SS in his capacity as Reich Commissioner
for the Preservation of German Nationality.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 4 I quote Paragraph IV:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German Police is
authorized to give the State Secretary for Security direct
instructions in the province of security and the preservation
of German Nationality.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document will be Exhibit Frank-3 (Document Number
Frank-3).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following the decree of the Führer of 7 May 1942 comes the
decree for the transfer of authority to the State Secretary for
Security, of 23 June 1942. I do not know whether that decree is
already bound in that volume. Apparently that decree, which was
added later, has not yet been translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the date?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: 23 June 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have one of 27 May 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: That decree apparently has not yet been translated
because it was added afterwards, and I will put it in the document
book later. It will be Document Frank-4. In Paragraph 1 of that
decree, we find, “The jurisdictions of the administrative and creative
branches of the Police referred to in appendices A and B are now
transferred to the State Secretary for Security.” In Appendix 1
the spheres of authority of the Order Police are mentioned under
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
15 headings—no, I must correct that—26 headings; and in Appendix
B the spheres of authority of the Order Police come under 21
headings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass now to Document Book I, Page 5. That is the decree of
the Führer concerning the appointment of officials and the termination
of this status as officials in the sphere of the Government
General, of 20 May 1942. I quote from the figure 3, Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General’s sphere of activity does not, in the
sense of this decree, include officials belonging to the province
of the Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German Police in
the Reich Ministry of the Interior, or those belonging to the
Customs Frontier Service.” (Document Number Frank-4(e).)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Page 6 of the document book, the decree of the Führer
and Reich Chancellor, for the Preservation of German Nationality,
of 7 October 1939, which is already Exhibit USA-305 (Document
Number 686-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document is the letter from Reich Marshal Göring to
the Chief of the Security Police and the SD, of July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, I suggest that an exhibit number
be given as we go along so that we can follow better, and later
on have some track of the exhibits as they go in. The last one and
this one have not been given any exhibit number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Francis Biddle, Member for the United
States): The last one was Frank-5, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No. Frank-5 was the one of the 27th of May
1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: We did not know that; we did not get the number
over the speaker. I am sorry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It may not have been stated but I took it
down as that myself. Will you take care to state each time, Dr. Seidl,
what the exhibit number is that you are giving. You are dealing
now with the letter of the 31st of July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes. This letter has a USA number, namely, 509.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Wait a minute, perhaps I made
a mistake. Yes, Mr. Dodd, I think I made a mistake. The reason
why Dr. Seidl did not give a number was because it was already
in evidence as USA-305. I made a mistake. It was not Frank-5.
He only got to Frank-4. The next one is USA-509.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: 509 (Document Number 710-PS). I pass to Page 10
of the document book. That is an order, a directive rather, of the
High Command of the Armed Forces concerning Case Barbarossa,
USA-135 (Document Number 447-PS), and I quote Paragraph 2:
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is not intended to declare East Prussia and the Government
General an operational area of the Army. On the other
hand, on the basis of the unpublished Führer decrees of 19
and 21 October 1939 the Commander-in-Chief of the Army
is authorized to enact measures that are necessary for the
execution of his military task and for the security of his
troops.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Page 11 of the document book, a directive for the
execution of the Führer decree concerning the Plenipotentiary
General for the Allocation of Labor, of 27 March 1942. I quote Paragraph
4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Plenipotentiary General for the Allocation of Labor will
have at his disposal for the performance of his tasks the
authority delegated to me by the Führer to issue instructions
to the highest Reich authorities, their subordinate offices,
as well as to the offices of the Party and its formations and
affiliated organizations; to the Reich Protector; to the Governor
General; to the military commanders and the chiefs of
the civil administrations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document becomes Exhibit Number Frank-5 (Document
Number Frank-5).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document is on Page 12—the decree by the Führer,
concerning a Plenipotentiary General for the Allocation of Labor,
of 21 March 1942, from which it can be seen that his authority to
issue instructions included the Government General. It becomes
Exhibit Number Frank-6 (Document Number Frank-6).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document on Page 13 of the document book deals also with
the authority of the Plenipotentiary General for the Allocation of
Labor to issue instructions. It is already Exhibit USA-206 (Document
Number 3352-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document on Page 15 is a letter from Professor Dr. Kubiowicz,
Chairman of the Ukrainian Control Committee, to the Defendant
Dr. Frank. It already has the Exhibit Number USA-178 (Document
Number 1526-PS); and I will read only the first sentence from that
document, in order to show what the relation was between the
Defendant Dr. Frank and the author of that letter. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Complying with your wish I send you this letter, in which I
should like to state the abuses and the painful incidents which
create an especially difficult position for the Ukrainian
population within the Government General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then I pass on to Page 16 of the document book. That is an
excerpt from Exhibit USA-275 (Document Number 1061-PS), namely,
the report of SS Brigadeführer Stroop about the destruction of the
Warsaw ghetto. I quote the second paragraph of Section II, from
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
which it can be seen that the order came directly from the Reichsführer
SS Himmler:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When the Reichsführer SS visited Warsaw in January 1943,
he ordered the SS and Police Leader in the District of Warsaw
to transfer to Lublin the armament factories and other enterprises
of military importance which were installed within the
ghetto, including the workers and the machines.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The affidavit which the Prosecution submitted during the cross-examination
of the Defendant Kaltenbrunner should then really
follow after Page 16 of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL Y. V. POKROVSKY (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for
the U.S.S.R.): As far as I can gather, there has been some misunderstanding
on this point. Under the number mentioned by
Dr. Seidl in his document book there is no document referring to
the Warsaw ghetto, but there is a document from the Chief of Police
and SS in Galicia relating to the solution of the Jewish problem
in Galicia. I should like this elucidated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The document on Page 16 is the report by the SS
Brigadeführer Stroop which has already been submitted as Exhibit
USA-275. The report by SS Führer Katzmann, which the Russian
Prosecutor apparently means, concerning the solution of the Jewish
question in Galicia, is on Page 17 of the document book, that is,
on the next page. Apparently the insertion of Page 16 in the document
book which was prepared for the Russian Prosecution was
overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that report by Brigadeführer Stroop, Exhibit USA-275
should be inserted as Page 16a, the affidavit by SS Brigadeführer
Stroop which was submitted during the cross-examination of the
Defendant Dr. Kaltenbrunner under Exhibit Number USA-804. That
affidavit bears the Document Number 3841-PS. I could not include
that affidavit in the document book because it was submitted by
the Prosecution only after I had sent the document book to be
translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Page 16b another document should be put in which was also
submitted during the cross-examination of Dr. Kaltenbrunner. That
is the affidavit by Karl Kaleske. That affidavit bears the Exhibit
Number USA-803, Document Number 3840-PS. That would be
Page 16b of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I come to the report which the Soviet Prosecutor had in
mind and which deals with the solution of the Jewish question in
Galicia. It is on Page 17 of the document book. That measure has
the Exhibit Number USA-277 and the Document Number L-18. I
quote Pages 4 and 5, word for word:
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After it had been found in more and more cases that Jews had
succeeded in making themselves indispensable to their
employers by providing them with scarce goods, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, it
was considered necessary to introduce really Draconic
measures.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Paragraph 2 and quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“As the administration was not in a position and showed
itself too weak to master this chaos, the SS and Police Leader
simply took over the whole question of the employment of
Jewish labor. The Jewish labor agencies, which were staffed
by hundreds of Jews, were dissolved. All employment certificates
given by firms or administrative offices were declared
invalid, and cards given Jews by the labor agencies were
made valid again by being stamped by the police offices.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Page 19 of the document book. That deals with the
letter of the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery to
Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German Police Himmler, of
17 April 1943. That document is Number 2220-PS and Exhibit
Number USA-175. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In our conference of 27 March of this year we had agreed to
prepare written memoranda about conditions in the Government
General on which to base our intended report to the
Führer.</p>

<p>“The material compiled for this purpose by SS Obergruppenführer
Krüger has already been submitted to you directly.
On the basis of this material I have had a report prepared
which sums up the most important points contained therein,
subdivides them clearly, and culminates in an explanation of
the measures to be taken.</p>

<p>“The report has been checked with SS Obergruppenführer
Krüger and has his complete concurrence. I am submitting a
part of it to you herewith.”—It is signed—“Dr. Lammers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass on to Page 20 of the document book and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Secret. Concerning conditions in the Government General...</p>

<p>“The German administration in the Government General has
to accomplish the following tasks: 1) To increase agricultural
production for the purpose of securing food for the German
people and seize as much of it as possible, to allot sufficient
rations to the native population occupied with work essential
to the war effort, and to remove the rest for the Armed Forces
and the homeland.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I leave out the following points and pass to the letter “B”, where
Krüger or his assistant criticized the measures of the Governor
General. I quote:
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“German administration in the Government General has failed
grossly with respect to the tasks listed under “A”. Even if a
relatively high percentage, namely, over 90 percent, of the
delivery quota of agricultural products for the Armed Forces
and the homeland was successfully met in the year 1942 and
if the labor procurement requirements of the homeland were
generally satisfied, nevertheless, on the other hand, two things
must be made clear: First, these accomplishments were not
achieved until the year 1942. Before that, for example, only
40,000 tons of bread grain had been delivered for the Wehrmacht.
Secondly, and above all, there was the omission to
create for the attainment of such performances those prerequisites
of an organizational, economic, and political
character which are indispensable if such performances are not
to lead to a breakdown in the situation as a whole, from which
chaotic conditions in every respect could eventually come
about. This failure of the German administration can be
explained in the first place by the system of the German
administrative and governmental activity in the Government
General as embodied in the Governor General himself, and
secondly by the misguided principles of policy in all questions
decisive for conditions in the Government General.</p>

<p>“I) The spirit of the German administration in the Government
General.</p>

<p>“From the beginning it has been the endeavor of the Governor
General to make a state organization out of the Government
General which was to lead its own existence in complete
independence of the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then I pass to Page 22 of the report, Paragraph 3 and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“3) The treatment of the native population can only be led in
the right direction on the basis of clean and orderly administrative
and economic leadership. Only such a foundation
makes it possible to handle the native population firmly and
if necessary even severely, on the one hand; and, on the other
hand, to act generously with them and cause a certain amount
of satisfaction among the population by allowing certain
liberties, especially in the cultural field. Without such a
foundation severity strengthens the resistance movement, and
meeting the population halfway only undermines respect for
the Germans. The above-mentioned facts prove that this
foundation is lacking. Instead of trying to create this
foundation, the Governor General inaugurates a policy of
encouraging the individual cultural life of the Polish population,
which in itself is already overshooting the goal but which,
under the existing conditions and viewed in connection with
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
our military situation during the past winter, can only be
interpreted as weakness, and must achieve the opposite of
the aim intended.</p>

<p>“4) The relationship between racial Germans and the Polish-Ukrainian
population in the Government General.</p>

<p>“The cases are numerous in which the German administration
has permitted the requirements of racial Germans in the
Government General to be put into the background in favor
of the interests of the Poles and Ruthenians, in its endeavor
to win over the latter. The opinion was advanced that racial
Germans resettled from somewhere else were not to be
installed immediately as settlers, but for the duration of the
war were only to be employed as farm workers. A legal
foundation for the expropriation of Polish property has not
been created so far. Bad treatment of racial Germans by
their Polish employers was not stopped. German citizens and
racial German patients were allowed to be treated in Polish
hospitals by Polish physicians, badly and at great expense. In
German spas in the Government General the sheltering of
children of German citizenship from territories threatened
with bombing, and of veterans of Stalingrad was hampered,
while foreigners took convalescent vacations there, and so on.</p>

<p>“The big plans for resettlement in the Lublin district for the
benefit of racial Germans could have been carried out with
less friction if the Reich Commissioner for the Preservation
of German Nationality had found the administration willing
to co-operate and assist in the proper manner.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to Page 24 and quote, under C:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The administrative system, embodied in the Governor
General personally, and the material failure of the general
German administration in the most various fields of decisive
importance has not only shaken the confidence and the will
to work of the native population, but has also brought about
the result that the Poles, who have been socially divided and
constantly disunited throughout their history, have come
together in a united national body through their hostility to
the Germans. In a world of pretense, the real foundations
are lacking on which alone the achievements which the Reich
requires from the Government General, and the aims which it
must see realized in the latter, can be brought about and
fulfilled in the long run. The non-fulfillment of the tasks
given to the general administration—as happened, for
example, in the field of the Preservation of German Nationality—led
to a condition which made it necessary for other
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
administrative bodies (the Reich Commissioner for the Preservation
of German Nationality...and the Police) to take
over these tasks.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now I pass to Page 27 of the document book. That is the
repeatedly mentioned report by the Governor General to the Führer
of 19 June 1943. The document is Number 437-PS, Exhibit
USA-610. Of this document the Prosecution has so far quoted
only Pages 10 and 11. These are the very points in this memorandum
which the Governor General most severely criticized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you speaking now of the report which
begins on Page 20?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I am speaking of the report which begins on Page 27.
I have already finished the report which begins on Page 20.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, what number did you give to that on
Page 20?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The report on Page 20 is an integral part of the
letter which begins on Page 19, and which already has the number
USA-175.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I see, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Now I come to the document on Page 27. That is a
memorandum which has already been mentioned by various
witnesses and was submitted under Exhibit Number USA-610
(Document Number 437-PS) by the Prosecution. Of this report the
Prosecution has only read Pages 10 and 11, which are Pages 36 and
37 of the document book, that is to say, only those passages in the
report which were condemned as excesses of the Police, and against
which excesses the Governor General complained to the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not intend to read the whole memorandum; but I will pass
on to Page 27 of the report, which is Page 53 of the document book,
and I quote under Section 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The almost complete discontinuation of the possibilities for
participation in the cultural field has led, even among the
lowest classes of the Polish people, to considerable discontent.
The Polish middle and upper classes have a great need for
self-expression. Experience shows that the possibility of
cultural activity would at the same time mean a diversion
from the political questions of the day. German propaganda
frequently comes across the objection, on the part of the Poles,
that the restriction of cultural activity enforced by the German
authorities not only prevents a contrast being made with the
Bolshevist lack of culture, but also shows that Polish cultural
activity falls below the degree of culture allowed to Soviet
citizens...
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span></p>

<p>“3. The closing of colleges, high schools, and secondary schools
is on the same level. Its well-considered purpose is without
doubt the lowering of the Polish educational standard. The
realization of this goal appears, from the point of view of the
necessities of war, not always beneficial to German interests.
As the war goes on the German interest increases in the
mobilization of able foreign replacements in the various fields
of knowledge. But more important than that is the fact that the
crippling of the school system and the severe hampering of
cultural activities foster the growth of a Polish national body,
led by the intelligentsia, to conspire against Germany. What
was not possible during the course of Polish national history,
what even the first years of German dominion could not bring
about, namely, the achievement of national unity in a common
purpose to hold together through thick and thin, now
threatens to become a reality, slowly but surely, because of the
German measures. German leadership cannot allow this
process of unifying the individual classes of the Polish population
to pass unheeded in the face of the growing power of
resistance of the Poles. German leadership should promote
class distinction by certain cultural concessions and should be
able to play one class off against the other.</p>

<p>“4. The recruiting of labor and the methods employed, even
though often exercised under the unavoidable pressure
of circumstances, have, with the aid of clever Bolshevist agitation,
evoked a strong feeling of hatred among all classes. The
workers thus obtained often come to work with firm resolve
to engage in positive resistance, even active sabotage. Improvement
of recruiting methods, together with the continued
effort to arrest the abuses still practiced in the treatment of
Polish workers in the Reich, and lastly, some provision,
however meager it may be, for the families left behind,
would cause a rise in morale, and the result would be an
increased desire to work and increased production in the
German interest.</p>

<p>“5. When the German administration was set up at the beginning
of the war the Polish element was removed from all
important positions. The available German staff had always
been inadequate in quantity and quality. Besides, during the
past year, a considerable number of German personnel have
had to be transferred to meet the replacement needs of the
armed forces. Already an increased amount of non-German
manpower has had to be obtained compulsorily. An essential
change in the treatment of the Poles would enable the administration,
while exercising all necessary precaution, to induce
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
a greater number of Poles to collaborate. Without this the
administration, in view of the present amount of personnel—not
to speak of future transfers—cannot continue to function.
The increased participation of Poles would further help to
raise the morale itself.</p>

<p>“Besides the positive changes set down in these proposals, a
number of methods employed up till now in the treatment of
Poles should be changed or even completely abandoned, at
least for the duration of the fighting in Europe.</p>

<p>“1) I have already shown in special reports that confiscation
and evacuation of agricultural land have caused great and
irreparable damage to agricultural production. Not less great
is the damage to morale caused by such actions. Already
the seizure of a great part of the large Polish estates has
understandably embittered those affected by it, who naturally
represent that strata of the population which is always anti-Bolshevist.
But, because of their numerically small strength
and their complete isolation from the mass of the people, their
opposition does not count nearly as much as the attitude of the
mass of the population which consists mainly of small farmers.
The evacuation of Polish peasants from the defense zone, no
doubt necessary for military-political reasons, has already had
an unfavorable effect on the opinion and attitude of many
farmers. At any rate, this evacuation was kept within certain
territorial limits. It was carried out with careful preparation
on the part of the governmental offices with a view to avoiding
unnecessary hardship. The evacuation of Polish farmers from
the Lublin district, held to be necessary by the Reich Commissioner
for the Preservation of German Nationality, for the
purpose of settling racial Germans there, was much more
serious. Moreover—as I have already reported separately—the
pace at which it was carried out and the methods adopted
caused immeasurable bitterness among the populace. At short
notice families were torn apart; those able to work were sent
to the Reich, while old people and children were directed to
evacuate Jewish ghettos. This happened in the middle
of the winter of 1942-43 and resulted in considerable
loss of life, especially among members of the last mentioned
group. The dispossession meant the complete expropriation
of the movable and immovable property of the farmers. The
entire population succumbed to the belief that these deportations
meant the beginning of a mass deportation of the Poles
from the region of the Government General. The general impression
was that the Poles would meet a fate similar to that
of the Jews. The evacuation from the Lublin District was a
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
welcome opportunity for communist agitation, with its own
peculiar skill, to poison the feeling in the entire Government
General, and even in the annexed Eastern territories, for
a long time. Thus it came about that considerable portions
of the population in the territories to be evacuated, but also in
territories not affected, fled into the woods and considerably
increased the strength of the guerrillas. The consequence was
a tremendous deterioration of the security situation. These
desperate people were incited by skillful agents to upset agricultural
and industrial production according to a definite plan.</p>

<p>“2) One has only to mention the crime of Katyn for it to
become obvious that the safeguarding of personal security
is an absolute condition for winning over the Polish population
to the fight against Bolshevism. The lack of protection
against seemingly arbitrary arrests and executions makes good
copy for communist propaganda slogans. The shooting of
women, children, and old men in public, which took place
again and again without the knowledge and against the will of
the government, must be prevented in all circumstances.
Naturally this does not apply to the public executions of
bandits and partisans. In cases of collective punishments,
which nearly always hit innocent persons and are applied
against people who are fundamentally politically indifferent,
the unfavorable psychological effect cannot possibly be overestimated.
Serious punitive measures and executions should
be carried out only after a trial based at least upon the
elementary conceptions of justice and accompanied by publication
of the sentence. Even if the court procedure is carried on
in the most simple, imperfect and improvised manner, it
serves to avoid or to lessen the unfavorable effect of a punitive
measure which the population considers purely arbitrary, and
disarms Bolshevist agitation which claims that these German
measures are only the prelude to future events. Moreover,
collective punishment, which by its nature is directed
primarily against the innocent, in the worst case against
forced or desperate persons, is not exactly looked upon as
a sign of strength of the ruling power, which the population
expects to strike at the terrorists themselves and thereby
liberate them from the insecurity which burdens them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass now to Page 37 of the report and quote under Section 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Besides the most important prerequisites mentioned
in 1) and 2) to restore calm in the Government General,
security of property among non-agricultural people must also
be guaranteed, insofar as it is not counter to the urgent needs
of war. Expropriation or confiscation without compensation
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
in the industrial sector, in commerce and trade, and of other
private property, should not take place in any case if the
owner or the custodian has not committed an offense against
the German authorities. If the taking over of industrial
enterprises, commercial concerns, or real estate is necessary
for reasons connected with the war, one should proceed in
every case in such a way as to avoid hardship and under
guarantee of appropriate compensation. Such a procedure
would on the one hand further the initiative of Polish business
men, and on the other hand avoid damage to the interests of
German war economy.</p>

<p>“4) In any attempt to influence the attitude of the Poles, importance
must be attached to the influence of the Catholic
Church which cannot be overestimated. I do not deny that the
Catholic Church has always been on the side of the leading
fighters for an independent national Poland. Numerous
priests also made their influence felt in this direction even
after the German occupation. Hundreds of arrests were carried
out among them. A number of priests were taken to concentration
camps and also shot. However, in order to win over
the Polish population, the Church must be given at least a
legal status even though it might not be possible to co-operate
with it. It can without doubt be won over to reinforce the
struggle of the Polish people against Bolshevism, especially
today under the effect of the crime of Katyn, for the Church
would always oppose a Bolshevist regime in the Vistula area,
if only out of the instinct of self-preservation. To achieve
that end, however, it is necessary to refrain in the future from
all measures against its activity and its property, insofar as
they do not run directly counter to war requirements.</p>

<p>“Much harm has been done even quite recently by the closing
of monasteries, charitable institutions, and church establishments.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I had thought that your extracts were going
to be brief. But you have now read from Page 53 to Page 65.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, this document is the only one of this
kind which is available to me, and in view of the fact that the
Prosecution has quoted in full only those passages which the Defendant
Dr. Frank himself criticized most severely, I consider it my
duty now to read a number of passages, to quote them, in order to
give the entire picture correctly and to show what the Defendant
Dr. Frank really intended to achieve with this document. I shall
only quote a few more lines and then I will pass to another
document.
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I had hoped that one or two extracts from
that document would show what the Defendant Frank was putting
forward—one or two paragraphs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I will go on to the next document, Mr. President,
that is on Page 68, the affidavit by the witness Dr. Bühler, which
I presented to the witness today and which has been given the
document number Frank-1; Page 68 in the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 70 there appears Exhibit USA-473 (Document Number
L-49). If I remember correctly this document has already been read
in full by the Prosecution, and I would like to ask the Court only
to take judicial notice of that also in the defense of Dr. Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 72 of the document book is an affidavit of the former
Kreishauptmann, Dr. Albrecht. To be exact I have to state that
this is not really an affidavit in the true sense of the word. It is
only a letter which Kreishauptmann Dr. Albrecht sent to me through
the General Secretary of the Tribunal. I then returned the letter
in order to have it sworn to by the witness, but I have to say that
until now that sworn statement has not been returned, so that for
the time being this exhibit would only have the material value of
a letter. Therefore I ask the Tribunal to decide whether that
document can be accepted by the Tribunal as an exhibit in the form
of a letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think the Tribunal did consider that matter
before when your application was before it. They will accept the
document for what it is worth. If you get the document in affidavit
form you will no doubt put it in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes. That will be Document Number Frank-7. I
forego the quoting of the first points and proceed directly to Page
74 of the document book and I quote under Section 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Dr. Frank’s fight against the exploitation and neglect of the
Government General in favor of the Reich. Conflict with
Berlin.</p>

<p>“The first meeting with Dr. Frank occurred shortly after the
establishment of the Government General in the autumn of
1939, in the Polish district capital Radom, where the 10 Kreis
chiefs of this district had to report concerning the condition of
the population in their administrative district and the problem
of reconstructing, as quickly and effectively as possible, the
general as well as the administrative and economic life. What
struck one most was the keen awareness of Dr. Frank and his
deep concern about the area entrusted to him. This found
expression in the instructions not to consider or treat the
Government General or allow it to be treated, as an object of
exploitation or as a waste area, but rather to consider it as
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
a center of public order and an area of concentration at the
back of the fighting German front and at the gates of the German
homeland, forming a link between the two. Therefore the
loyal native inhabitants of this country should have claim
to the full protection of the German administration as citizens
of the Government General. To this end the constant efforts
of all authorities and economic agencies would be demanded
by him, also constant control through supervisors, which
would be personally superintended by him in periodical inspection
trips with the participation of the specialized central
offices. In this way, for instance, the two districts which were
administered by me were inspected by him personally three
times in 4 years.</p>

<p>“In face of the demands of the Berlin central authorities, who
believed it possible to import more from the Government
General into the Reich than the former could afford, Dr. Frank
asserted vigorously the political independence of the Government
General as an ‘adjunct of the Reich’ and his own independence
as being directly subordinated only to the Supreme
Head of the State, and not to the Reich Government. He also
instructed us on no account to comply with demands which
might come to us on the basis of personal relations with the
authorities by whom we were sent, or with the ministries
concerned; and if by so doing we came into conflict with our
loyalty to the Reich, which was equally expected of us, to
report to him about it. This firm attitude brought Dr. Frank
the displeasure of the Berlin government circles, and the
Government General was dubbed ‘Frankreich.’ A campaign of
calumny was initiated in the Reich against him and against
the entire administration of the Government General by systematically
generalizing and exaggerating regrettable ineptitudes
and human weaknesses of individuals, at the same time
attempting to belittle the actual constructive achievements.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to ask the Tribunal merely to take official notice of
Section 5, also Section 6, and I will only quote from Section 7.</p>

<p>“Besides the exploitation and the pauperization of the Government
General, the accusation of the enslaving of the native
population as well as deporting it to the Reich, and many
atrocities of various kinds which have appeared in the newspaper
reports on the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial, were
interpreted as serious evidence against Dr. Frank. As far
as atrocities are concerned, the guilt lies not with Dr. Frank
but in some measure with the numerous non-German agitators
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
and provocateurs who, with the growing pressure on the
fighting German fronts, increased their underground activity;
but more especially with the former State Secretary for
Security in the Government General, SS Obergruppenführer
Krüger, and his agencies. My observations in this respect are
sketchy, because of the strict secrecy of these offices.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, Dr. Frank went so far in meeting the
Polish population that this was frequently objected to by his
German compatriots. That he did the correct thing by his
stand for the just interests of the Polish population is proved,
for example, by the impressive fact that barely a year and a
half after the defeat of the Polish people in a campaign of
18 days, the concentration of German army masses against
Russia in the Polish area took place without any disturbance
worth mentioning, and that the Eastern railroad was able,
with Polish personnel, to move the troop transports up to the
most forward unloading points without being delayed by acts
of sabotage.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I quote the last paragraph on Page 79:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This humane attitude of Dr. Frank, which earned him respect
and sympathy among considerable groups of the native
population, led, on the other hand, to bitter conflicts with the
SS, in whose ranks Himmler’s statement, ‘They shall not love
us, but fear us,’ was applied as the guiding principle of their
thoughts and deeds.</p>

<p>“At times it came to a complete break. I still recall quite
clearly that during a government visit to the Carpathian areas
in the summer of 1943 in the district center of Stanislav, when
he took a walk alone with me and my wife in Zaremcze on
the Prut, Dr. Frank complained most bitterly about the
arbitrary acts of the SS, which quite frequently ran counter to
the political line taken by him. At that time he called the
SS the ‘Black Plague’; and when he noticed our astonishment at
hearing such criticism coming from his lips, he pointed out
that if, for example, my wife were to be wrongfully arrested
one day or night by agencies of the Gestapo and disappear,
never to be seen again, without having been given the opportunity
of defense in a court trial, absolutely nothing could be
done about it. Some time afterwards he made a speech to the
students in Heidelberg, which attracted much attention and
was loudly applauded, about the necessity for the re-establishment
of a German constitutional state such as had always met
the real needs of the German people. When he wanted to
repeat this speech in Berlin, he is said to have been forbidden
by the Führer and Reich Chancellor, at Himmler’s instigation,
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
to make speeches for 3 months, as reported to me by a reliable,
but unfortunately forgotten, source. The struggle against
the methods of violence used by the SS led to Dr. Frank’s
having a nervous breakdown, and he had to take a fairly long
sick leave. As far as I can remember this was in the winter
of 1943-44.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Court to take official notice of Section 8, and I pass on
to Page 84 of the document book. That is an affidavit by SS Obergruppenführer
Erich Von dem Bach-Zelewski, of 21 February 1946.
This affidavit becomes Document Frank-8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did this witness not give evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The witness was questioned here by the Prosecution,
and I made the motion at that time that either I be allowed
to interrogate the witness again or be granted the use of an affidavit.
On 8 March 1946 the Tribunal made the decision, if I remember
correctly, that I could use an affidavit from that witness but that
the Prosecution would be free if they desired to question the
witness again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I shall read the statements of the witness concerning
this matter, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“1) Owing to the infiltration of Russian partisan groups over
the line of the river Bug into the Government General in 1943,
Himmler declared the Government General to be a ‘guerrilla
warfare territory.’ Thus it became my duty as Chief of Anti-Partisan
Units to travel about the Government General to
collect information and get experience, and to submit reports
and suggestions for fighting the partisans.</p>

<p>“In the general information Himmler gave me, he called the
Governor General Dr. Frank a traitor to his country, who
was conspiring with the Poles and whom he would expose
to the Führer very shortly. I still remember two of the
reproaches Himmler made against Frank:</p>

<p>“a) At a lawyer’s meeting in the Old Reich territory Frank
is said to have stated that ‘he preferred a bad constitutional
state to the best conducted police state’; and</p>

<p>“b) During a speech to a Polish delegation Frank had
disavowed some of Himmler’s measures and had disparaged, in
front of the Poles, those charged with carrying them out, by
calling them ‘militant personalities.’</p>

<p>“After having, on a circular tour, personally obtained information
on the spot about the situation in the Government
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
General, I visited the higher SS and Police Führer Krüger
and the Governor General, Dr. Frank, in Kraków.</p>

<p>“Krüger spoke very disapprovingly about Dr. Frank and
blamed Frank’s faltering and unstable policy towards the
Poles for conditions in the Government General. He called for
harsher and more ruthless measures and said that he would
not rest until the traitor Frank was overthrown. I had the
impression, from Krüger’s statements, that personal motives
also influenced his attitude, and that he himself would have
liked to become Governor General.</p>

<p>“After that I had a long discussion with Dr. Frank. I told
him of my impressions; and he went into lengthy details about
a new policy for Poland, which aimed at appeasing the Poles
by means of concessions. In agreement with my personal
impressions Dr. Frank considered the following factors
responsible for the crisis in the Government General:</p>

<p>“a) The ruthless resettlement action carried out now in the
midst of war, especially the senseless and purposeless resettlement
carried out by the SS and Police Führer Globocznik in
Lublin.</p>

<p>“b) The insufficient food quota allotted to the Governor
General.</p>

<p>“Dr. Frank called Krüger and Globocznik declared enemies
of any conciliatory policy, and said it was absolutely essential
that they should be recalled.</p>

<p>“Being convinced that if Dr. Frank failed, he would be succeeded
only by a more ruthless and uncompromising person,
I promised him my support. Having been assured of strictest
secrecy I told Frank I shared his opinion that Krüger and
Globocznik would have to disappear. He, Dr. Frank, knew
however that Himmler hated him and that he was urging
Hitler to have him removed. With such a state of affairs any
request on Frank’s part to have Krüger and Globocznik recalled
would not only be rejected but would even strengthen
their position with Himmler. Frank should give me a free
hand, then I could promise him that both would be relieved
of their posts within a short time. Dr. Frank agreed to that,
and I then made use of the military mistakes that Krüger and
Globocznik had committed in order to bring about their recall
by Himmler.</p>

<p>“3) The Warsaw revolt of 1944...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I must point out to you that you said you
were going to be only 2 hours over five volumes. You have now
been over an hour over one volume, and you are reading practically
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
everything in these documents. It is not at all what the Tribunal
has intended. You have been told that you may make short comments
showing how the documents are connected with each other
and how they are connected with all the evidence. That is not
what you are doing at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In that case I ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of Paragraph 3 of the affidavit by Von dem Bach-Zelewski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 3 deals with the Warsaw revolt in the year 1944 and
the question as to whether the Governor General had anything to
do with the crushing of that revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I pass on to Page 92.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As a matter of fact, does the Indictment
charge anything in connection with the crushing of the Warsaw
revolt in 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: There is nothing in the Indictment itself about
the part played by the Governor General in the crushing of that
revolt. The Soviet Prosecution have, however, submitted a telegram
which, while it is not clear whether it was sent, nevertheless
connects the Defendant Dr. Frank in some way with the Warsaw
revolt. But I shall not go into details about that now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pass on to Page 92 of the document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is an affidavit by the witness Wilhelm Ernst von Palezieux,
in whose case the Tribunal has approved an interrogatory. But I
was told by the Tribunal that in place of an interrogatory I could
submit an affidavit. I quote only the two main paragraphs as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The art treasures stored in the castle in Kraków, from the
spring of 1943, were under official and legal supervision there.
When speaking to me Dr. Frank always referred to these art
treasures as state property of thy Government General.
Catalogues of the existing art treasures had already been
made before I came to Poland. The list of the first selection
had been printed in book form as a catalogue with descriptions
and statements of origin, and had been ordered by the
Governor General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now you are reading the affidavit all over
again. We do not want that sort of...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President. I assumed that in those cases where
a witness does not appear before the Tribunal in person, it is
admissible that either the interrogatory or the affidavit be read,
because otherwise the contents of his testimony would not become
part of the record nor, therefore, part of the proceedings.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That rule was in order that the defendants
and their counsel should have the document before them in German;
that is the reason for reading the documents through the earphones.
The Tribunal will adjourn now, but I want to tell you that you
must shorten your presentation of this documentary evidence. We
have already been a good deal more than an hour over one book
and we have four more books to deal with, and it does not do your
case any good to read all these long passages because we have some
more weeks of the trial. It is only necessary for you to give such
connecting statements as make the documents intelligible, and to
correlate them with the oral evidence that is being given.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 24 April 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEENTH DAY</span><br/> Wednesday, 24 April 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Tribunal: I left off
yesterday at the last document of Volume I. It is the affidavit of
the witness Ernst von Palezieux, and I ask the Tribunal to take
judicial notice of it. The affidavit is given the document number
Frank-9, and that completes the first volume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The first volume, what page?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: That was Page 92 of the first volume, Document
Frank-9.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. That is the end of the first volume, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, that is the end of the first volume. Volumes II,
III, and IV of the document book comprise extracts from the diary
of the Defendant Dr. Frank. I do not propose to number all these
extracts individually, but I ask the Tribunal to accept the whole
diary as Document Frank-10 (Document 2233-PS), and I propose to
quote only a few short extracts. For example Pages 1 to 27, Mr. President,
are extracts from the diary which have already been submitted
by the Prosecution. I have put the extracts submitted by the
Prosecution into a more extensive context, and by quoting the
entire passages I have attempted to prove that some of these extracts
do not represent the true and essential content of the diary. Those
are Exhibits USA-173, on Page 1 of the document book, USSR-223
on Page 3, USA-271 on Page 8, USA-611 on Page 11 of the document
book. On Page 14 of the document book there appears to be a
misprint. The USA number is not 016 but 613.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It begins on Page 13 in my copy, doesn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: No, it is on Page 14. It is an entry dated
25 January 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the document that I have and which
I think you are referring to, is Document 2233 (aa)-PS, Exhibit
USA-613. That is on Page 13. I don’t think it makes any difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In that case it must be an error by the Translation
Department. At any rate I do not think it is important, I mean this
quotation.
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 20 of the document book, a quotation by the
Soviet Prosecution. On Page 22 there is a quotation by the Soviet
Prosecution. Page 24 of the document book contains quotations by
the Prosecution of both the United States and of the Soviet Union.
Exhibit USA-295. Perhaps I may point out that these extracts are
only a few examples merely to show that in a number of cases
the impression obtained is different if one reads either the entire
speech or at least a portion of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then turn to Page 32 of the document book, an entry dated
10 October 1939, in which the Defendant Dr. Frank gives instructions
for negotiations with the Reich Food Ministry regarding the
delivery of 5,000 tons of grain per week—Page 32 of the document
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 34 there is an entry of 8 March 1940, and I quote the
first three lines. The Governor General states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In close connection therewith is the actual governing of
Poland. The Führer has ordered me to regard the Government
General as the home of the Polish people. Accordingly, no
Germanization policy of any kind is possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now pass on to Page 41 of the document book; an entry dated
19 January 1940. I quote the first five lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Dr. Walbaum (Chief of the Health Department): The state of
health in the Government General is satisfactory. Much has
already been accomplished in this field. In Warsaw alone
700,000 typhus injections have been given. This is a huge total,
even for German standards; it is actually a record.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is on Page 50 of the document book, an entry
dated 19 February 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General is further of the opinion that the
need for official interpretation of Polish law may become
greater. We should probably have to come to some form of
Polish government or regency, and the head of the Polish
legal system would then be competent for such a task.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid there seems to have been some
slight difference in the paging and therefore if you would give us
carefully and somewhat more slowly the actual date of the document
we should be able to find it perhaps for ourselves. The pages
do not seem to correspond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The last quotation which I read was dated 19 February
1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to a quotation; that is, an entry of 26 February 1940,
and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In this connection the Governor General expresses...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This is on Page 51 in my book. The entry is of 26 February 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Page 40 in ours.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>DR. SEIDL: “In this connection the Governor General expresses
the wish of Field Marshal Göring that the German
administration should be built up in such a way that the
Polish mode of living as such is assured. It should not give
the impression that Warsaw is a fallen city which is becoming
germanized, but rather that Warsaw, according to the Führer’s
will, is to be one of the cities which would continue to exist as
a Polish community in the intended reduced Polish state.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A further entry, dated 26 February 1940, deals with the question
of higher education. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General points out in this connection that the
universities and high schools have been closed. However, in
the long run it would be an impossible state of affairs, for instance,
to discontinue medical education. The Polish system
of technical schools should also be revived and with the
participation of the city.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is on Page 56 of my document book. An entry
of 1 March 1940.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General announces in this connection that the
directive has now been issued to give free rein to Polish
development as far as it is possible within the interests of the
German Reich. The attitude now to be adopted is that the
Government General is the home of the Polish people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A further entry deals with the question of workers in the
Reich territory. Page 60 of my document book, entry of 19 September
1940—I beg your pardon, 12 September 1940. I quote:</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a moment. You mean the first of September,
do you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: 12 September—no, it should be 12 March; there is
obviously a misprint; 12 March 1940, Page 197 of the diary. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Governor General Dr. Frank emphasizes that one could
actually collect an adequate number of workers by force following
the methods of the slave trade, by using a sufficient
number of police, and by procuring sufficient means of transportation;
but that, for a number of reasons, however, the
use of propaganda deserves preference under all circumstances.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is on Page 68 in my document book; an
entry of 23 April 1940. I quote the last five lines. The Governor
General states:
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General is merely attempting to offer the
Polish nation protection in an economic respect as well. He
was almost inclined to think that one could achieve better
results with Poles than with these autocratic trustees....”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 71 of my document book, an entry dated
25 May 1940. Here the Governor General gives an explanation to the
President of the Polish Court of Appeal, Bronschinski. I quote the
last four lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We do not wish to carry on a war of extermination here
against a people. The protection of the Polish people by the
Reich in the German zone of interest gives you the possibility
of continuing your development according to your national
traditions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Page 77 of my document book, an entry from Volume III,
July to September, Page 692. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General then spoke of the food difficulties
still existing in the Government General”—this was to Generaloberst
von Küchler—“and asked the general to see to it
that the provisioning and other requirements of new troops
arriving should be as light a burden as possible on the food
situation of the Government General. Above all, no confiscation
whatsoever should take place.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Pages 85 and 86; entries in Volume III, July to September
1940, Page 819 of the diary. This entry deals with the
establishment of the medical academy which was planned by
the Governor General. I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of
this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is on Page 95 of the document book, an entry
dated 9 October 1940, from the speech of the Governor General on
the occasion of the opening of the autumn trade fair at Radom.
I quote Line 5.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is clear that we...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, the important things for us are
the page in the diary and the date. We seem to have the pages in
the diary and the dates, so if you will tell us them that will be of
the greatest help to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The date is 9 October 1940; Pages 966-967 of the
diary, I quote Line 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is clear that we do not wish to denationalize, nor shall
we germanize.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The translation in our book of that sentence is:
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is clear that we neither want to denationalize nor degermanize.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: That is apparently an error in the translation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In which translation? In the one I have just
read out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In the English translation. I shall now quote
literally:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is clear that we neither wish to denationalize nor shall we
germanize.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The other makes no sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is what I read. Well, it is right in our
book anyhow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The Governor General wished to say that we did
not want to deprive the Poles of their national character and that
we did not intend to turn them into Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 101, to an entry dated 27 October 1940,
Pages 1026 to 1027 of Volume IV of the diary. A conference with
Reich Minister of Labor Seldte. I quote, Line 7:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He, the Governor General, had complained to the Führer
that the wages of Polish agricultural laborers had been reduced
by 50 percent. In addition, their wages had for the most
part been used for purposes which were completely foreign
to the idea of this exchange of workers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is dated 29 November 1940. It is on Page 1085
in Volume IV, of the year 1940. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Hofrat Watzke further states that Reichsleiter Rosenberg’s
office was attempting to confiscate the so-called Polish Library
in Paris, for inclusion in the Ahnenerbe in Berlin. The Department
of Schools was of the opinion that the books of this
Polish library belonged to the state library in Warsaw, as
17,000 volumes were already in Warsaw.</p>

<p>“The Governor General ordered that this Polish library
should be transferred from Paris to Warsaw without delay.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the next entry, dated
6 and 7 June 1940, which refers to an economic conference. I shall
not read from the entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is dated 25 February 1940. It deals with a
conference of the department chiefs, prefects, and town majors of
the district of Radom. I quote Page 12:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Thereupon the Governor General spoke, and made the
following statements:”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It goes on from Page 13:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“1. The Government General comprises that part of the occupied
Polish territory which is not an integral part of the
German Reich...</p>

<p>“2. This territory has primarily been designated by the Führer
as the home of the Polish people. In Berlin the Führer, as
well as Field Marshal Göring, emphasized to me again and
again that this territory would not be subjected to Germanization.
It is to be set aside as the national territory of the
Polish people. In the name of the German people it is to be
placed at the disposal of the Polish nation as their reservation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The speech of the Governor General ends two pages further.
I quote the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“There is one thing I should like to tell you: The Führer has
urged me to guarantee the self-administration of the Poles
as far as possible. Under all circumstances they must be
granted the right to choose the Wojts and the minor mayors
and village magistrates from among the Poles, which would
be to our interest as well.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to the entry of 4 March 1940. From the volume of
conferences, February 1940 to November 1940, Page 8:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General submits for consideration the question
of whether a slight pressure could not be exerted through
proper use of the Compulsory Labor Order. He refuses to ask
Berlin for the promulgation of a new decree defining special
measures for the application of force and threats. Measures
which might lead to unrest should be avoided. The shipping
of people by force has nothing in its favor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last quotation in my document book is on Page 143. It is
an entry dated 27 January 1941, Volume I, Page 115. A conference
between State Secretary Dr. Bühler and the Reich Finance Minister,
Count Schwerin von Krosigk. I quote the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is due to the efforts of all personnel employed in the Government
General that, after surmounting extraordinary and
unusual difficulties, a general improvement in the economic
situation can now be noted. The Government General, from
the day of its birth, has most conscientiously met the demands
of the Reich for strengthening the German war potential. It
is, therefore, permissible to ask that in future the Reich should
make no excessive demands on the Government General, so
that a sound and planned economy may be maintained in the
Government General, which, in turn, would prove of benefit
to the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That completes Volume II of the document book.
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to Volume III and I ask the Tribunal to refer to
a quotation on Page 17 in my document book. It is an entry following
a government meeting of 18 October 1941. I quote the eighth
line from the bottom; it is a statement of the Governor General:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I shall first of all state, when replying to these demands”—that
means, the demands of the Reich—“that our strength has
been exhausted and that we can no longer take any responsibility
as regards the Führer. No instructions, orders, threats,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>, can induce me to answer anything but an emphatic
‘no’ to demands which, even under the stress of wartime
conditions, are no longer tolerable. I will not permit a situation
to arise such as you, Mr. Naumann, so expressly indicated,
such as, for example, placing large areas at the disposal of
the troops for maneuvers and thus completely disrupting
the food supply which is already utterly insufficient.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is on Pages 36 and 37 of my document book.
It is an entry dated 16 January 1942, and the quotation to which
I am referring is on the next page—Pages 65 and 66 of the diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Later on a short discussion took place in the King’s Hall
of the Castle.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It took place with the chief of the Ukrainian committee. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General desires a larger employment of Ukrainians
in the administrative offices of the Government General.
In all offices in which Poles are employed there should
also be Ukrainians in proportion to the number of their population.
He asked Professor...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, if you will give us the page in
your document book now, that will be sufficient for the present,
because they seem to correspond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Very well. May I continue, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think so, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I then come to Page 38 in the document book. This
entry deals with a law drafted by Himmler, which has already been
mentioned, regarding the treatment of aliens in the community.
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General orders the following letter to be sent
to Landgerichtsrat Taschner:</p>

<p>“ ‘Please inform Reich Minister Dr. Lammers of my opinion
which follows with my signature certified by yourself: I am
opposed to the law on the treatment of people foreign to the
German community, and I request that an early date be set
for a meeting of leading officials with regard to the draft so
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
that it may be possible to set forth the principal legal viewpoints
which today still emphatically contradict this proposal
in its details. I shall personally attend this meeting. In my
opinion it is entirely impossible to circumvent the regular
courts and to transfer such far-reaching authority exclusively
to police organizations. The intended court at the Reich Security
Main Office cannot take the place of a regular court in
the eyes of the people.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 39 I quote the last paragraph but one:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“For that reason I object to this draft in its present form,
especially with regard to Paragraph 1 of the decree concerning
the order of its execution.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 40 is an entry dated 7 June 1942 which also deals with that
question of denationalization so emphatically denied by the Governor
General. I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of this document.
The next quotation is on Page 47 and deals with the acquisition
of Chopin’s posthumous works. I quote Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“President Dr. Watzke reports that it would be possible to
procure in Paris the major part of Chopin’s posthumous wonks
for the State Library in Kraków. The Governor General
approves of the purchase of Chopin’s posthumous works
through the government of the Government General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 50 deals with an entry in the diary which concerns the
securing of agricultural property. I quote Page 767 of the diary,
Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is my aim to bring about agricultural reform in Galicia
by every possible means, even during the war. I thus have
kept the promises which I made a year ago in my proclamation
to the population of this territory. Further progress of
a beneficial nature can therefore result through the loyal co-operation
of the population with the German authorities. The
German administration in this area is willing, and has also
been given orders to treat the population well. It will protect
the loyal population of this area with the same decisive and
fundamental firmness with which it will suppress any attempt
at resistance against the order established by the Greater
German Reich. For this purpose, for the protection of the individual
farmer, I have issued an additional decree concerning
the duties of the German administration for food and agriculture
in Galicia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Page 55 of the document book. This concerns a speech,
made by the Governor General before the leaders of the Polish
Delegation, and I quote the last paragraph on Page 56, Line 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I hope that the new harvest will place us in a position to
assist the Polish Aid Committee. In any event we will do
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
whatever we can to check the crisis. It is also to our interest
that the Polish population should enjoy their work and co-operate.
We do not want to exterminate or annihilate anybody...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 61 of the document book deals with a conference which
the Governor General held with the Plenipotentiary General for the
Allocation of Labor. I quote the last paragraph on Page 919 of the
diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I would also like to take this opportunity of expressing to
you, Party Comrade Sauckel, our willingness to do everything
that is humanly possible. However, I should like to add one
request: The treatment of Polish workers in the Reich is still
subject to certain degrading restrictions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Page 62 and quote Line 10:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I can assure you, Party Comrade Sauckel, that it would
be a tremendous help in recruiting workers, if at least part of
the degrading restrictions against the Poles in the Reich could
be abolished. I believe that could be effected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 66 of the document book. This is the only
entry in the diary of the Defendant Dr. Frank which he has signed
personally. It is a memorandum on the development in the Government
General after he had been relieved of all his positions in the
Party, and had repeatedly stated that he was resigning and hoped
that now at last his resignation would be accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of this final survey,
dated 1 September 1942. It consists of five pages: Pages 66 to 71.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is on Page 75 and deals with the safeguarding
of art treasures. I quote the fifth line from the bottom. It is a statement
made by the Governor General:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The art treasures were carefully restored and cleaned, so
that approximately 90 percent of all the art treasures of the
former state of Poland in the territory of the Government
General could be made safe. These art treasures are entirely
the property of the Government General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 92 of this volume. It is
an entry dated 8 December 1942, which was made on the occasion
of a meeting of departmental chiefs and which deals with the supply
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of that entry. The same
for the entry on Page 93, in which the Governor General speaks
of the question of recruiting workers and most severely condemns
all measures of force.
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next entry, which appears important to me and which should
be read into the record, is on Page 108. It concerns a press conference,
and I ask the Tribunal to turn directly to Page 110. I quote
the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General sums up the result of the conference
and states that, with the participation of the president of the
department for propaganda and the press chief of the Government,
all points will be comprised in a directive to be
issued to all leading editors of the Polish papers. Instructions
for the handling of matters concerning foreigners, in the press
and in the cultural field, will be included in this directive.
The conciliatory spirit of the Reich will serve as a model.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 127 of the document book,
a conference of 26 May 1943, which deals with the question of food.
I quote the eighth line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We must understand that the first problem is the feeding of
the Polish population; but I would like to say, with complete
authority, that whatever happens with the coming rationing
period in the Government General, I shall, in any case, allot
to the largest possible number of the population such food
rations as we can justifiably afford in view of our commitments
to the Reich. Nothing and nobody will divert me from
this goal...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 131 of the document book deals with a committee of the
Governor General for supplies for the non-German working population.
I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of these statements,
and I now turn to Page 141. This entry also deals with the food
situation. I quote the tenth line from the bottom:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After examining all possibilities I have now ordered that as
from 1 September of this year, the food situation of the Polish
population of this territory shall also be regulated on a
generous scale. By 1 September of this year we shall introduce,
for the population of this territory, the rations which are
called the ‘Warthegau rations.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask permission to quote a few sentences from Page 142:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I should like to make a statement to you now. From the
seriousness with which I utter these words, you can judge
what I have in mind. I myself and the men of my Government
are fully aware of the needs also of the Polish population
in this district. We are not here to exterminate or
annihilate it, or to torment these people beyond the measure
of suffering laid upon them by fate. I hope that we shall
come to a satisfactory arrangement in all matters that sometimes
separate us. I personally have nothing against the
Poles...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 148. It is a conference which deals with
young medical students. I quote Page 149, Paragraph 2, which is
a statement by the Governor General:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This first—we can safely call it Ministry of Health, even
though this expression is not used—is something entirely
new. This department for health will have to deal with
important problems. For us, the physicians in this territory,
there is above all a lack of...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I have just discovered that an error may possibly
have occurred, since these statements on Page 672 were perhaps
not made by the Governor General himself but by the head of the
Health Department. I shall examine this question again and then
submit the result to the Tribunal in writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 155 of the document book. This entry seems
to me of a vital nature. It is dated 14 July 1943 and deals with the
establishment of the State Secretariat for Security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is not in our book, apparently. We haven’t
got a Page 155, and we haven’t got a date, I think, of the 14th of July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: It is July 1943. It has probably been omitted. With
the approval of the Tribunal I shall read the sentences in question
into the record. There are only three sentences:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General points out the disastrous effect which
the establishment of the State Secretariat for Security has
had on the authority of the Governor General. He said that a
new police and SS government had tried to establish itself
in opposition to the Governor General which it had been
possible to suppress only at the expense of a great deal of
energy and at the very last moment.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I then ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 166 of the document
book. This entry deals with general questions regarding the policy
in Poland. I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 193 deals with the establishment of the Chopin Museum
which was created by the Governor General. I quote Page 1157 of
the diary, which is an extract from the Governor General’s speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Today I have inaugurated the Chopin Museum in Kraków.
We have saved and brought to Kraków, under most difficult
circumstances, the most valuable mementos of the greatest of
Polish musicians. I merely wanted to say this in order to
show you that I want to make a personal effort to put things
in order in this country as far as possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last quotation is on Page 199 of Volume II of the document
book. It is an extract from a speech which Reichsführer SS Himmler
made on the occasion of the installation of the new Higher SS
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
and Police Leader in Kraków, before the members of the Government
and the Higher SS and Police Leaders. This is the speech which
the Defendant Frank mentioned when he was examined. I quote
the eighth line from the bottom:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“You are all very familiar with the situation: 16 million
aliens and about 200,000 Germans live here; or if we include
the members of the Police and Wehrmacht, perhaps 300,000.
These 16 million aliens, who were augmented in the past by
a large number of Jews who have now emigrated or have
been sent to the East, consist largely of Poles and to a lesser
degree of Ukrainians.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to the last document of this volume, Page 200, an entry
dated 14 December 1943. It concerns a speech which the Governor
General made to officers of the Air Force. I quote the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Therefore, everything should be done to keep the population
quiet, peaceful, and in order. Nothing should be done to
create unnecessary agitation among the population. I mention
only one example here:</p>

<p>“It would be wrong if now, during the war, we were to
undertake the establishment of large German settlements
among the peasantry in this territory. This attempt at colonizing,
mostly through force, would lead to tremendous
unrest among the native peasant population. This, in turn,
from the point of view of production, would result in a
tremendous loss to the harvest, in a curtailment of cultivation,
and so on. It would also be wrong forcibly to deprive the
population of its Church, or of any possibility for leading
a simple cultural life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Page 201, and I quote the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We must take care of these territories and their population.
I have found, to my pleasure and that of all of our colleagues,
that this point of view has prevailed and that everything that
was formerly said against the alleged friendship with the
Poles or the weakness of this attitude, has dwindled to nothing
in face of the facts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That completes Volume II of the document book—I beg your
pardon, I meant Volume III. Now I come to Volume IV of the document
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 1 of the document book deals with a conversation which
took place on 25 January 1943 with the SS Obergruppenführer
Krüger. I quote the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General states that he had not been previously
informed about the large-scale action to seize asocial elements
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
and that this procedure was in opposition to the Führer’s
decree of 7 May 1942, according to which the State Secretary
for Security must obtain the approval of the Governor
General before carrying out instructions by the Reichsführer
SS and Chief of the German Police. State Secretary Krüger
states that this concerned secret instructions which had to
be carried out suddenly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to take cognizance of the fact that this is
merely an example of many similar discussions and differences of
opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 24 of the document book. This concerns a
meeting of the War Economy Staff and the Defense Committee on
22 September 1943. I hope that the pages tally again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You said Page 24, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Page 24, an entry of 22 September 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It looks as though the paging is right. Our
book is Page 24 at the top, so perhaps you will continue to quote
the page for a moment or two. We will see whether it goes on right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: This concerns an entry dated 22 September 1943,
a meeting of the War Economy Staff and the Defense Committee.
I quote only the first lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the course of the past few months, in the face of the
most difficult and senseless struggles, I have had to insist on
the principle that the Poles should, at last, be given a sufficient
quantity of food. You all know the foolish attitude of
considering the nations we have conquered as inferior to us,
and that at a moment when the labor potential of these
peoples represents one of the most important factors in our
fight for victory. By my opposition to this absurdity, which
has caused most grievous harm to the German people, I personally—and
many men of my government and many of
you—have incurred the charge of being friendly or soft
towards the Poles.</p>

<p>“For years now people have not hesitated to attack my government
of this area with the foulest arguments of this kind,
and behind my back have hindered the fulfillment of these
tasks. Now it has been proved as clear as day that it is insane
to want to reconstruct Europe and at the same time to
persecute the European nations with such unparalleled
chicanery.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 34 of the document book, an entry dated
20 April 1943, concerning a government meeting. I ask the Tribunal
to take judicial notice of the final words only of the Governor
General’s speech on Page 38 of the document book and Page 41 of
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
the diary. Then I turn to Page 39 of the document book, a meeting
of 22 July 1943; I quote from the second paragraph, the tenth line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The question of the resettlement was altogether particularly
difficult for us in this year. I can give you the good news
that resettlement in general has been completely discontinued
for the duration of the war. With regard to the transferring
of industries, we have just started to work at full speed. As
you know—I personally attach great importance to it—we
have to satisfy this need of the Reich, and in the coming
months we shall install great industrial concerns of international
renown in the Government General.</p>

<p>“However, with regard to this question we must consider the
almost complete reconstruction of the Government General
which has consequently been forced upon us. While, until
now, we have always figured as a country supplying the Reich
with labor, as an agricultural country, and the granary of
Europe, we shall within a very short time become one of
the most important industrial centers of Europe. I remind
you of such names as Krupp, Heinkel, Henschel, whose
industries will be moved into the Government General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 41 of the document book.
It is the statement which was made by the witness Doctor Bühler on
26 October 1943, in which he states that this report dealt with
4 years of reconstruction in the Government General on the basis
of reliable information from the 13 chief departments. The statement
includes Pages 42 to 69 of the document book. I do not propose
to quote from this statement, but I ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I go straight on to Page 70 of the document book, which concerns
a government meeting dated 16 February 1944. I quote the last
paragraph, Page 4 of the document book.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“As opposed to this, the fact must be established that the
development, construction, and securing of that which today
gives this territory its importance were possible only because
it was necessary, in opposition to the ideas of the advocates
of brute force—so completely untimely during a war—to
bring the human and material resources of this area into
the service of the German war effort in as constructive a
manner as possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next quotation is Page 74; an entry dated 6 March 1944.
I quote the last paragraph on Page 75, Page 5 of the diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General does not, as a matter of principle,
oppose the training of the younger generation for the priesthood
because, if courses for doctors, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, are arranged,
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
similar opportunities must also be created in the field of
religion.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 77 deals with an order by the Governor General prohibiting
the evacuation of the population, or a part of it, which was in the
fighting zone near Lublin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 80 is an entry dated 12 April 1944. I quote the second
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In this connection President Gerteis spoke of the treatment
of the Poles in the Reich. This treatment, said to be worse
than that of any other foreign workers, had led to the result
that practically no Poles would volunteer any more for work
in Germany.</p>

<p>“There were 21 points on which the Polish workers in the
Reich were more badly treated than any other foreign
workers. The Governor General requested President Gerteis
to acquaint him with these 21 points which he would certainly
attempt to have abolished.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I now ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 100 of the document
book. It concerns a conference on 6 June 1944 regarding a large-scale
action against the partisans in the Bilgoraje Forest. I quote
Page 101, Page 4 of the diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General wants to be quite sure that protection
is given to the harmless population, which is itself suffering
under the partisan terror.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Page 102 deals with the views of the Governor General on concentration
camps. It is an entry dated 6 June 1944. I quote the last
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General declared that he would never sign
such a decree, since it meant sending the person concerned
to a concentration camp. He stated that he had always protested
with the utmost vigor against the system of concentration
camps, for it was the greatest offense against the sense
of justice. He had thought there would be no concentration
camps for such matters, but they had apparently been silently
put into operation. It could only be handled in such a manner
that the persons condemned would be pardoned to jail or prison
for a certain number of years. He pointed out that prison
sentences, for instance, were imposed and examined by state
institutions. He therefore requested that State Secretary
Dr. Bühler should be informed that he, the Governor General,
would not sign such decrees. He did not wish concentration
camps to be officially sanctioned. He went on to say that
there was no pardon which would commute a sentence into
commitment to a concentration camp. The courts-martial are
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
state legal organs of a special character and consist of police
units; actually they should normally be staffed by members
of the Wehrmacht.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, can you explain the translation of
the words at the bottom of Page 102 which are in English, “It only
could be handled in such a manner that the persons would be
pardoned to jail or prison for a certain number of years.” Can you
explain that from the point of view of meaning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: The meaning of the words becomes clear from the
statement made by President Wille in the previous paragraph where,
among others, you will find the following statement. It is the tenth
line from the top.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reprieve Commission had asked the representative of
the Chief of the Security Police, who was present at the
session, in what form this pardon was to be effected. As far
as he knew, remittance of a sentence had been allowed in one
case only. In all other cases it was customary to couple Security
Police measures with the remittance of a sentence. It
was feared that otherwise these people might disappear.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Governor General was of the opinion that, for example,
to transmute a death sentence to a term in prison or penitentiary
was possible but that he would have to refuse direct commutation
of a death penalty into a suspended prison penalty if the Police in
that event were to impose security measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean that it meant that pardon from a
death sentence might be made by a reprieve for a sentence in prison
for a certain number of years, but not by sending to a concentration
camp, which would be for an indefinite period and under police
methods?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, that is the sense of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to Page 104 of the document book. This quotation
also deals with the general question of treatment of the population
in the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, you have been very much longer
than you said, and the Tribunal thinks you might be able to cut
down a great deal of this. It is all very much on the same lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes. In that case, I ask the Tribunal to turn to
Page 112 of the document book, an entry dated 10 July 1944. This
entry deals with the official control of art treasures. I quote the
second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Governor General instructs the expert Palezieux to have
a complete index made of these art treasures.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have already told us and given us some
evidence to support the view that the Defendant Frank was preserving
the art treasures and was wishing them to be preserved in
Poland, and it is not necessary under those circumstances to go
reading passages about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Very well. Then I ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of that entry; and if the Tribunal agrees, I shall merely give
you the pages of the documents in the document book which appear
important to me. That is page...</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The proceedings were interrupted by technical difficulties in the
interpreting system.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen of the Tribunal, if the Court is agreeable I
should like to give only the numbers of the pages of Volume IV
of the document book which seem particularly important to me.
These are the Pages 115, 121, 123, 134, 139, 152, and 182. That concludes
Volume IV of the document book and I come to the last
volume of the document book which will be finished considerably
faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Volume V deals exclusively with the accusations made by the
Prosecution of the United States against the Defendant Frank concerning
his activity as President of the Academy for German Law,
as President of the National Socialist Lawyers’ Association, and
similar positions. Page 1 is a document which has already been submitted
by the Prosecution, 1391-PS. It still has no USA number and
will be Exhibit Number Frank-11. It is the law regarding the Academy
for German Law with the necessary statutes and the tasks
resulting therefrom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to page 25 of the document book. This quotation becomes
Exhibit Frank-12 (Document Number Frank-12). It deals with a
sentence which has been ascribed to the defendant: “Right is that
which is good for the people.” This quotation should prove only that
the Defendant Dr. Frank wanted to express nothing more than that
which is implied in the Roman sentence: <span class='it'>Salus publica suprema lex</span>
(The supreme law is the welfare of the people). I ask the Court to
take cognizance of this and turn to Page 26 of the document book,
an excerpt from the magazine of the Academy for German Law of
1938. That will be Exhibit Frank-13 (Document Number Frank-13).
This quotation also deals with the afore-mentioned sentence: “Right
is that which is good for the people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 30 is an excerpt from Exhibit USA-670 (Document Number
3459-PS) and deals with the closing celebration of the “Congress of
German Law 1939” at Leipzig, where the Defendant Dr. Frank
made the concluding speech before 25,000 lawyers. I quote on
Page 31, Line 10 from the bottom:
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Only by applying legal security methods, by administering
true justice, and by clearly following the legislative ideal of
law can the national community continue to exist. This legal
method which permanently ensures the fulfillment of the
tasks of the community has been assigned to you, fellow
guardians of the law, as your mission. Ancient Germanic principles
have come down to us through the centuries.</p>

<p>“1) No one shall be judged who has not had the opportunity
to defend himself.</p>

<p>“2) No one shall be deprived of the incontestable rights which
he enjoys as a member of the national community, except by
decision of the judge. Honor, liberty, life, the profits of labor
are among those rights.</p>

<p>“3) Regardless of the nature of the proceedings, the reasons
for the indictment, or the law which is applied, everyone who
is under indictment must be given the opportunity to have a
defense counsel who can make legal statements for him; he
must be given a legal and impartial hearing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to Page 35 of the document book, which deals with a
speech, an address by the Defendant Dr. Frank, made at a meeting
of the heads of the departments of the National Socialist Lawyer’s
Association on 19 November 1941. The speech—that is, the excerpt—becomes
Exhibit Number Frank-14 (Document Number Frank-14).
I quote only a few sentences at the top of Page 37.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Therefore, it is a very serious task which we have imposed
upon ourselves and we must always bear in mind that it can
be fulfilled only with courage and absolute readiness for self-sacrifice.
I observe the developments with great attention.
I watch every anti-juridical tendency. I know only too well
from history—as you all do—of the attempts made to gain
ever-increasing power in general directions because one has
weapons with which one can shoot, and authority on the basis
of which one can make people who have been arrested disappear.
In the first place, I mean by this not only the attempts
made by the SS, the SD, and by the police headquarters,
but the attempts of many other offices of the State and the
Reich to exclude themselves from general jurisdiction.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I turn to—I would like to quote the last five lines on Page 41.
Those were the last words spoken during that session:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“One cannot debase law to an article of merchandise; one
cannot sell it; it exists or it does not exist. Law is not an
exchange commodity. If justice is not supported, the State
loses its moral foundation; it sinks into the abyss of darkness
and horror.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document is on Page 42. It is the first address which
the Defendant Dr. Frank made in Berlin at the university on 8 June
1942. It will be Exhibit Number Frank-15 (Document Number
Frank-15). I quote Page 44, second paragraph, seventh line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On the other hand, however, a member of the community
cannot be deprived of honor, liberty, life, and property; he
cannot be expelled and condemned without first being able to
defend himself against the charges brought against him. The
Armed Forces serve us as a model in this respect. There
everyone is a free, honored member of the community, with
equal rights, until a judge—standing independently above him—has
weighed and judged between indictment and defense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I then turn to Page 49 of the document book, the second of these
four long speeches. It was held in Vienna, and will become Exhibit
Number Frank-15.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have already had Exhibit Frank-15 on
Page 41.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: No, I beg your pardon, Mr. President; it will be
Frank-16 (Document Number Frank-16). I quote only one sentence
on Page 51.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I shall continue to repeat with all the strength of my conviction
that it would be an evil thing if ideals advocating
a police state were to be presented as distinct National Socialist
ideals, while old Germanic ideals of law fell entirely into the
background.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now I ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 57 of the document book
to the speech made by the Defendant Dr. Frank at the University
of Munich, on 20 July 1942. This will be Exhibit Frank-17 (Document
Number Frank-17). I quote on Page 58, Line 16:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is, however, impossible to talk about a national community
and still regard the servants of the law as excluded from this
national community, and throw mud at them in the midst of
the war. The Führer has transferred the tasks of the Reich
Leader of the Reich Legal Office and that of the leader of the
National Socialist Lawyers’ Association to me, and therefore
it is my duty to state that it is detrimental to the German
national community if in the ‘Black Corps’ lawyers are called
‘sewer-rats.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Tribunal to turn to Page 67 of the document book.
That is the speech which he made at Heidelberg on 21 July 1942.
That will be Exhibit Frank-18 (Document Number Frank-18). I ask
the Tribunal to take official notice of that speech. On Page 69 I
quote only one sentence: “But never must there be a police state,
never. That I oppose.”
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the last document which the Prosecution of the
United States has already submitted under Exhibit Number USA-607
(Document Number 2233(x)-PS), an excerpt from the diary: “Concluding
reflections on the events of the last three months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these reflections Dr. Frank once more definitely states his
attitude towards the concept of the legal state, and I ask the Tribunal
to take cognizance particularly of his basic assumptions on Pages 74
and 75 of the document book. Here, Dr. Frank again formulated the
prerequisites which he considered necessary for the existence of
any legal state. I quote only a few lines from Page 74:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“1) No fellow German can be convicted without regular court
procedure, and only on the basis of a law in effect before
the act was committed.</p>

<p>“2) The proceedings must carry full guarantee that the accused
will be interrogated on all matters pertaining to the
indictment, and that he will be able to speak freely.</p>

<p>“3) The accused must have the opportunity, at all stages of
the trial, to avail himself of the services of defense counsel
acquainted with the law.</p>

<p>“4) The defense counsel must have complete freedom of action
and independence in carrying out his office in order to strike
an even balance between the State prosecutor and the
defendant.</p>

<p>“5) The judge or the court must make his or its decision
quite independently—that is, the verdict must not be influenced
by any irrelevant factors—in logical consideration of the
subject matter and in just application of the purport of the
law.</p>

<p>“6) When the penalty imposed by the sentence has been
paid, the act has been expiated.</p>

<p>“7) Measures for protective custody and security custody
may not be undertaken or carried out by police organs, nor
may measures for the punishment of concentration camp
inmates, except from this aspect, that is, after confirmation
of the intended measures by regular, independent judges.</p>

<p>“8) In the same manner, the administration of justice for
fellow Germans must guarantee full safeguarding of individual
interests in all relations pertaining to civil suits
proper.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, are there any passages in these
documents which express the opinion that the same principles ought
to be applied to others than fellow Germans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: In this last quotation the Defendant Dr. Frank dealt
basically with questions of law without making any difference here
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
between Germans and people of foreign nationality. However, in
his capacity as Governor General he also fundamentally objected
at all times to the transfer of Poles, Ukrainians, and Jews to concentration
camps. This can be seen from a whole series of entries in
the diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this I have come to the end of my evidence for Dr. Frank.
There are left only the answers to interrogatories by witnesses
whose interrogation before a commission has been approved by the
Court. At a later date I shall compile these interrogations in a
small document book and submit the translation thereof to the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are speaking of interrogatories where
you have not yet got the answers; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: These are interrogatories to which the answers
have not yet been received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Well, as soon as you have received them
you will furnish them to the Prosecution and to the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Pannenbecker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO PANNENBECKER (Counsel for Defendant Frick): In
presenting evidence for the Defendant Frick, I shall forego calling
the defendant himself as a witness. The questions which require an
explanation deal mainly with problems relating to formal authority
and also with problems which differentiate between formal authority
and actual responsibility. These are problems, part of which have
already been elucidated by the interrogation of Dr. Lammers and
the rest of which will be cleared up by the submission of documents.
One special field, however, cannot be entirely clarified by
documents; and that is the question of the actual distribution of
authority within the sphere of the Police; but for that special field I
have named the witness Dr. Gisevius. He is the only witness whose
interrogation seems to be necessary for the presentation of evidence
in the case of Frick. Therefore, in the meantime, I have dispensed
with other witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask the Court to decide whether I should call the witness
Dr. Gisevius first or whether I should submit my documents first.
If documents are to be presented first, I believe that I could finish
by the midday recess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can finish your documents before the
adjournment, do you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes. I believe so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Until 1:00 o’clock?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you indifferent whether you call the
witness first or whether you present the documents first?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that perhaps it would
be more convenient to give the documents first. They hope that
you will be able to finish them reasonably quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 1, 2, and 3 of the document book (Documents Number
386-PS, L-79, and 3726-PS) deal with evidence concerning the
question of whether the members of the Reich Cabinet knew about
Hitler’s preparation for aggressive war. I need not read the documents;
they have already been submitted, and they show that Hitler
gave information of his plans for aggression only to those of his
assistants who had to know of these plans for their own work, but
did not inform Frick who, as Minister of the Interior, was responsible
for the internal policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the scope of the war preparation, Frick was made Plenipotentiary
for Reich Administration by the Reich Defense Law of
4 September 1938, which has already been submitted, Exhibit
Number USA-36 (Document Number 2194-PS). This law does not
indicate that this position had anything to do with the known
preparation of an aggressive war; it shows only the participation
of the Administration of the Interior in a general preparation and
organization in the event of a future war. I have therefore included
in the document book an excerpt from this law under Number 4 of
the document book, in order to correct an error. The Defendant
Frick himself stated in an affidavit on 14 November 1945, that he
had held the position of Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration
from 21 May 1935. This is the date of the first Reich Defense Law,
which has already been submitted as Exhibit Number USA-24
(Document 2261-PS). The first Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935,
however, does not provide for the position of Plenipotentiary for
Reich Administration; that is contained only in the second law of
4 September 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This second law has been submitted under Exhibit Number
USA-36. Following this erroneous statement which the Defendant
Frick made without having the two laws on hand, the Prosecution
has also stated that Frick held the position of Plenipotentiary for
Reich Administration from 21 May 1935, while actually he held it
only from 4 September 1938, that is, the date of the second law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 5 and 6 of the document book have already been submitted
by the Prosecution. They also prove nothing except the
participation of the Defendant Frick in the establishment of civil
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
administration with a view to a possible future war. It is not necessary
to read this either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution considers Hitler’s aggressive intentions to be so
well known and so obvious as to require no further proof. The
Prosecution on that assumption came to the conclusion that participation
in the National Socialist Government, in any field whatsoever,
would in itself imply the conscious support of aggressive
war. In opposition to that I have referred to evidence in documents
from Number 7 to 10 inclusive of the Frick document book (Documents
Number 2288-PS, 2292-PS, 2289-PS, and 3729-PS) which have
already been submitted by the Prosecution and which show that
Hitler in public, as well as in private conversations, from the time
he came into power followed a definite policy of declaring his
peaceful intentions—a policy, therefore, which for considered
reasons, declared to all that to keep peace was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that these documents, which have already been submitted
to the Tribunal, must also be considered in order to decide
whether or not Hitler’s official policy, since his coming to power,
indicated that he had intentions of waging aggressive war. As
evidence in that direction, I should like to submit Number 11 and
Number 12 of the document book, which have not been presented
until now, and which I will submit as Documents Frick-1 and -2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first is a telegram of 8 March 1936 from Cardinal Archbishop
Schulte to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces at the time
of the occupation of the Rhineland in 1936. The second document
is a solemn declaration by the Austrian bishops occasioned by the
annexation of Austria in March 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first document states, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Cardinal Archbishop Schulte has sent to General Von Blomberg,
the Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces,
a telegram in which, at the memorable hour when the Armed
Forces of the Reich are re-entering the German Rhineland as
the guardians of peace and order, he greets the soldiers of our
nation with deep emotion mindful of the magnificent example
of self-sacrificing love of fatherland, stern manly discipline,
and upright fear of God, which our Army has always given
to the world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I particularly selected these two documents because the Catholic
Church is not suspected of sanctioning aggressive wars, or of
approving of Hitler’s criminal intentions in any other way. These
statements would have been unthinkable if the accusations of the
Prosecution were true, namely, that the criminal aims of Hitler and
particularly his aggressive intentions had been known.
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Pannenbecker, the Tribunal would like to
know what is the source of this telegram from the Archbishop,
Number Frick-11.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I took the telegram, Number Frick-11,
from the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> of 9 March 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And the other one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: The other document is from the <span class='it'>Völkischer
Beobachter</span> of 28 March 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 13 of the document book contains only one sentence,
taken from a speech made by Frick, from which it is evident that
Frick shared the same opinion. He states in this speech, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The national revolution is the expression of the will to eliminate
by legal means every form of external and internal
foreign domination.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You gave that the number 13, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon. That should be 3.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes, that is what I wanted to say. I
submit it as Document Number Frick-3.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: The Defendant Frick has been accused
particularly of working for the League for Germans Abroad. The
Prosecution saw in this activity a contribution by the Defendant
Frick to the preparation of aggressive wars. Frick’s actual attitude
regarding the aims of the League for Germans Abroad can be seen
from Number 14, which will be Document Number Frick-4. In a
speech made by Frick, it states, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The VDA (League for Germans Abroad) has nothing to do
with political aims or with frontier questions; it is, and is
intended to be, nothing more than a rallying point for German
cultural activities...the world over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Number 15, which is Exhibit Frick-5...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Pannenbecker, I perhaps ought to say
that in the index of this document book it looks as though the
exhibit numbers were the numbers of the documents in the order in
which they are put in the book, but that will not be so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: No, it will not be so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That last document which you just put in as
Exhibit Number 4 is shown in the book to be Exhibit Number 14,
which is a mistake. It is Document Number 14, but not Exhibit
Number 14.
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Number 14 of the document book, Exhibit
Number Frick-4 (Document Number Frick-4).</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Dealing with the same subject I have
entered in Number 15, Exhibit Number Frick-5 (Document Number
3358-PS), a decree of the Reich Minister of the Interior of
24 February 1933, which also deals with the question of the work of
the League for Germans Abroad. It states, and I quote...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has that not already been put in? I see it has
a PS number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: It has a PS number, but it was not then
submitted as evidence by the Prosecution. Therefore I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The suffering and misery of the times, the lack of work and
food within Germany, cannot divert attention from the fact
that about 30 million Germans, living outside of the present
contracted borders of the Reich, are an integral part of the
entire German people; an integral part, which the Reich
Government is not able to help economically but to which it
considers itself under an obligation to offer cultural support
through the organization primarily concerned with this task—the
League of Germans Abroad.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the documents from Number 16 to 24 inclusive of the document
book, which I need not read in detail, I have placed together
the legal decrees which deal with the competence of the Reich
Ministry of the Interior as a central office for certain occupied territories.
The tasks of this central office, which had no authority to
issue orders and no executive authority in any occupied territories,
have already been described by the witness Dr. Lammers; and these
tasks are specially entered in Number 24 of the document book. I do
not need to submit it in evidence. It is an official publication of the
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> and has, in addition, already been submitted as
3082-PS. In accordance with the fact that the central office had no
authority to issue orders in the occupied territories, there is in the
diary of Dr. Frank a confirmation that the Governor General alone
had authority to issue orders for the administration of his territory.
I do not need to quote this passage as it has already been submitted
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Police authority in the occupied territories was transferred
to Reichsführer SS Himmler; but Frick as Reich Minister of the
Interior had nothing to do with this either, since that authority was
vested exclusively in Himmler in his capacity as Reichsführer SS.
That can be seen from Number 26 of the document book, which also
already has been submitted as Exhibit USA-319 (Document Number
1997-PS).
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution further considers the Defendant Frick responsible
for the crimes committed in the Protectorate of Bohemia and
Moravia since August 1943, on the grounds that Frick had been
Reich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia since August 1943. In this
connection, I refer to Numbers 28 and 29 of the document book
(Documents Number 1366-PS and 3443-PS), from which it is evident
that, at the time that Frick was appointed, the former powers of the
Reich Protector had been subdivided between a so-called German
State Minister in Bohemia and Moravia—who, under the immediate
supervision of the Führer and Reich Chancellor, had to manage all
government affairs—and the Reich Protector Frick who was given
some special powers and in principle had the right to grant reprieves
on sentences passed by the local courts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick has also been accused of being responsible for the Political
Police, that is, the Secret State Police, and the concentration camps.
Until 1936 police matters were the affair of the individual states in
Germany; consequently in Prussia, Göring as Prussian Prime
Minister, and Prussian Minister of the Interior, built up the Political
Police and established the concentration camps. Frick, therefore, as
Reich Minister of the Interior, had no connection with these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1934 Frick also became Prussian Minister of the
Interior. Previously, however, Göring had by a special law taken
the affairs of the Political Police out of the jurisdiction of the office
of the Prussian Minister of the Interior and placed it under the
immediate supervision of the Prime Minister, an office which Göring
retained for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corresponding decrees have already been submitted by the
Prosecution as Documents Number 2104-PS, 2105-PS, and 2113-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same is evident from Document Number 30 in the document
book, which has also been submitted as Exhibit USA-233 (Document
Number 2344-PS).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in the Political Police sphere, Frick, until 1936, had only a
general right of supervision, such as the Reich had over the individual
states. He had, however, no special right of command in
individual cases, only the authority to issue general directives; and
in Numbers 31-33 of the document book I have entered a few of
these directives issued by Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote Number 31, which will be Exhibit Frick-6 (Document
Number 779-PS):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In order to correct the abuses resulting from the decree for
protective custody, the Reich Minister of the Interior, in his
directives of 12 April 1934 to the Land governments and
Reichsstatthalter anent the promulgation and execution of
decrees for protective custody, has determined that protective
custody may be ordered only: (a) for the protection of the
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
arrested person; (b) if the arrested person by his behavior,
and especially by activities directed against the State, has
directly endangered public security and order. Therefore,
protective custody is not permissible when the above-mentioned
cases do not apply, especially (a) for persons who
merely exercise their public and civil rights; (b) for lawyers
for representing the interests of their clients; (c) in the case
of personal matters, as for instance, insults; (d) because of
economic measures (questions of salary, dismissal of
employees, and similar cases).</p>

<p>“Furthermore, protective custody is not permissible as a
countermeasure for punishable actions, for the courts are
competent to deal with those cases.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the date of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: It is a document which the Prosecution
has submitted as 779-PS and which was taken from the files of the
ministry. There is no date on the document but it must have been
in the spring of 1934, as can be seen from the first sentence of the
document. The <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> mentions the same decree in
its issue of 14 April 1934. I have included that as Number 32 in the
document book; it will be Exhibit Frick-7 (Document Number
Frick-7).</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Pannenbecker, are you offering that as an
exhibit or has it already been put in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: No, it has not, as yet, been submitted.
I offer it as Exhibit Number Frick-7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am told the date is April 12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: In the spring of 1934, yes, shortly after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: 12th of April, 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> also mentions this decree in its issue
of 14 April 1934. We are concerned with Document 32 of the document
book, which will be Exhibit Number Frick-7. I do not need
to read it in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same is evident from Number 33 of the book, which will be
Exhibit Number Frick-8 (Document Number I-302).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 34 of the book—which will be Exhibit Number Frick-9
(Document Number 775-PS) shows that the Gestapo actually did not
adhere to Frick’s directives, and that Frick was powerless in that
connection. Nevertheless, the document appears important to me
because it shows that Frick tried repeatedly with great pains to
counteract the abuses of the Gestapo, which, however, with the
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
support of Himmler, was stronger than he—especially since Himmler
enjoyed the direct confidence of the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 June 1936, the affairs of the Political Police came under
the jurisdiction of the Reich. Himmler was appointed Chief of the
German Police and, though formally attached to the Reich Ministry
of the Interior, he functioned, in fact, as an independent Police
Ministry under the immediate authority of Hitler; and, as a minister,
he was privileged to look after his affairs in the Reich Cabinet
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This can be seen from Document Number 35 of the document
book—an excerpt from the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> which has been submitted
as 2073-PS. I do not believe that I have to give it an exhibit
number; it is an official announcement in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection the Prosecution has submitted Document
1723-PS as Exhibit USA-206. I have entered an extract from this
document as Number 36 in the document book in order to correct
an error. The document is an extract from a book written by
Dr. Ley in his capacity as Reich Organization Leader. In that book
Dr. Ley gives directives to the Party offices regarding co-operation
with the Gestapo, and at the end of the extract Ley reprinted a
decree by Frick which shows how Frick attempted to counteract
the arbitrary measures of the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, in presenting evidence on the morning of 13 December
1945, the Prosecution read the entire document as an order
by Frick. I should therefore like to correct that error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Himmler and the chiefs of the Gestapo did not heed Frick’s
general directives, Frick tried, at least in individual cases, to alleviate
conditions in concentration camps; but generally he was not
successful. To quote an example, I have included—under Number 37
of the document book—a letter by the former Reichstag Delegate
Wulle, which he sent to me of his own accord. This letter will be
Exhibit Number Frick-10 (Document Number Frick-10). The letter
states, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He”—Frick—“as my former counsel told me, has at various
times tried to persuade Hitler to release me; but without
success as it was Himmler who made all decisions regarding
concentration camps. However, I owe it to him that I have
been treated in a comparatively decent manner at the Sachsenhausen
Concentration Camp... He stood out from among the
Nazi demagogues because of his impartiality and reserve; he
was a man who by nature disapproved of any act of violence...
Since the spring of 1925 I have been involved in a
sharp struggle against Hitler and his party. I consider it even
more to Frick’s credit that despite this antagonism and his
comparatively powerless position with respect to Himmler,
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
he tried in every way to help my wife and me during the
bitter years of my imprisonment in the concentration camp...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has asserted, on the basis of the statements
made by the witness Blaha before this Tribunal, that Frick knew of
the conditions in the Dachau concentration camp through having
visited it in the first half of the year 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, with the permission of the Tribunal I submitted an
interrogatory to the witness Gillhuber, who accompanied Frick on
all his trips and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a moment, Dr. Pannenbecker. The
Tribunal considers that it cannot entertain an affidavit upon oath
from the Defendant Frick, who is not going into the witness box to
give evidence on oath, unless he is offered as a witness, in which
case he may be cross-examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes, but the last document was not an
affidavit by Frick, but by Gillhuber, a witness, who has received
an interrogatory. It is Number 40 of the document book. I am just
informed that by an oversight this exhibit has not been included
in the book; I shall have to submit it later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, well! Tell us what it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: It is an interrogatory of, and the
answers by, the witness Gillhuber. Gillhuber, for the personal protection
of the Defendant Frick, accompanied him on all his official
travels. In answering the interrogatory, he confirmed the fact that
Frick had never visited the camp. The interrogatory, with the
answers, has still to be submitted in translation. It is contained in
my book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may read the interrogatory, unless the
Prosecution has any objection to its admissibility, or the terms of it,
because the interrogatory has already been provisionally allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I read, then, from Number 40 of the
Frick document book, which becomes Exhibit Frick-11 (Document
Number Frick-11), the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question: From when until when, and in what capacity,
were you working for the Defendant Frick?</p>

<p>“Answer: From the 18 March 1936 until the arrival of the
Allied Troops on 29 or 30 April 1945, as an employee of the
Reich Security Service, as guard and escort.</p>

<p>“Question: Did you always accompany him on his travels for
his personal protection?</p>

<p>“Answer: From 1936 until January 1942 only intermittently,
but from January 1942 as office chief, I accompanied him on
all his trips and flights.
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span></p>

<p>“Question: Do you know whether the Defendant Frick visited
the concentration camp of Dachau during the first six months
of 1944?</p>

<p>“Answer: To my knowledge, Frick did not visit the Dachau
concentration camp.</p>

<p>“Question: Would you have known it had that been the case,
and why would you have known it?</p>

<p>“Answer: I would have had to know it had that been the case.
I was always close to him; and my employees would have
reported it if he had left during my absence.</p>

<p>“Question: Do you still have the log book of the trips you
made, and can you produce it now?</p>

<p>“Answer: From about 1941 log books were no longer kept.
Instead of that, monthly reports of trips were sent to the Reich
Security Service in Berlin. The copies which were kept in my
office were, according to orders, burned with all the rest of
the material in April 1945.</p>

<p>“Question: Do you know whether the Defendant Frick ever
visited the Dachau camp?</p>

<p>“Answer: To my knowledge Frick never visited the Dachau
Camp.</p>

<p>“Moosburg, 23 March 1946”.—Signed—“Max Gillhuber”—Signed—“Leonard
N. Dunkel, Lieutenant Colonel, Infantry.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To comment on the question whether an official visitor to a
concentration camp could always get a correct picture of the actual
conditions existing there, I ask permission to read an unsolicited
letter which I received a few days ago from a Catholic priest,
Bernard Ketzlick. This letter which I have submitted as Supplement
Frick Number...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your Honor, the Prosecution makes
objection to this because it is a character of evidence that there
is no way of testing. I have a basket of such correspondence
making charges against these defendants, which I would not think
the Tribunal would want to receive. If the door is open to this kind
of evidence, there is no end to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This witness has none of the sanctions, of course, that assure the
verity of testimony, and I think it is objectionable to go into letters
received from unknown persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: May I say just one word on this subject?
I received the letter so late that I did not have an opportunity to
ask the person concerned to send me an affidavit. Of course, I am
prepared to submit such an affidavit later, if such an affidavit
should have greater probative value.
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal think that the letter cannot be
admitted, but an application can be made in the ordinary way for
leave to put in an affidavit or to call the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes. Then, at a later date, I shall submit
a written request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not read Number 38 of the document book since it concerns
a statement made by Frick; and I refer, finally, to an excerpt
from the book <span class='it'>Inside Europe</span> by John Gunther which will be submitted
as Exhibit Frick-12 (Document Number Frick-12). The excerpt
is contained under Number 39 in the document book I quote—it
concerns a book which appeared originally in the English language,
and I therefore quote it in English:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Born in the Palatinate in 1877, Frick studied law and became
a Beamter, an official. He is a bureaucrat through and
through. Hitler is not intimate with him, but he respects him.
He became Minister of the Interior because he was the only
important Nazi with civil service training. Precise, obedient,
uninspired, he turned out to be a faithful executive; he has
been called the ‘only honest Nazi?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the last document, may I be permitted to refer to an extract
from the book <span class='it'>To the Bitter End</span> by Gisevius. I believe I do not
need to quote these passages individually, since the witness himself
will be questioned. The extract will be Exhibit Number Frick-13
(Document Number Frick-13).</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are still left two answers to interrogatories by the witnesses
Messersmith and Seger. I ask to be permitted to read these answers
later, as soon as the answers have been submitted to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That concludes the presentation of documents. I believe there
would be no purpose in calling the witnesses now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will now adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you prepared to call your witness,
Dr. Pannenbecker?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes, Mr. President, that is my request.
I now ask permission to call the witness Gisevius. He is the sole
witness in Frick’s case. I have especially selected witness Gisevius to
clarify the question of the state of the police authority in Germany,
as he, from the very beginning, has been on the side of the opposition
and is best qualified to give a picture of the state of that
authority in Germany at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Gisevius took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HANS BERND GISEVIUS (Witness): Hans Bernd Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, were you a member of the
NSDAP or one of its affiliated organizations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Is it correct that you personally participated
in the events of 20 July 1944, and that you were also present
in the OKW at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: How did you get into the police service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In July 1933 I passed the state examination in law.
As a descendant of an old family of civil servants I applied for a
civil service appointment in the Prussian administration. I belonged,
at that time, to the German National People’s Party and to
the Stahlhelm, and by the standards of that day I was considered
politically reliable. Consequently, at the first stage of my training
as a civil servant I was assigned to the Political Police, which meant
my entry into the newly created Secret State Police. In those days
I was very glad to have been assigned to the police service. I had
already at that time heard that abominations of all kinds were
going on in Germany. I was inclined to consider these as the final
outburst of the situation, akin to civil war, which we were experiencing
at the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933. So I hoped
to contribute to the re-establishment of a proper executive organization
which would provide for law, decency, and order. But this
happiness was doomed to be short-lived.
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I had scarcely been 2 days in this new police office, when I discovered
that incredible conditions existed there. These were not
police who took action against riots, murder, illegal detention, and
robbery; these were police who protected those guilty of such crimes.
It was not the guilty persons who were arrested, but rather those
who asked the police for help. These were not police who took
action against the crime, but police whose task seemed to be to
hush it up or, even worse, to sponsor it; for those SA and SS Kommandos
who played at being police in private were encouraged by
this so-called Secret State Police and were given all possible aid.
The most terrible and, even for a newcomer, most obvious thing
was that a system of unlawful detention was gaining more and
more ground—a worse and more dreadful system than which could
not be conceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The offices of the new State Police were in a huge building which
was, however, not large enough to take all the prisoners. Special
concentration camps for the Gestapo were established, and their
names will go down in history as a mark of infamy. These were
Oranienburg and the Gestapo’s private prison in Papestrasse, Columbia
House, or, as it was cynically nicknamed, “Columbia Hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to make it quite clear that this was certainly rather
amateurish compared with what all of us experienced later. But so
it started, and I can only convey my personal impression by describing
a brief incident I remember. After only 2 days I asked one
of my colleagues, who was also a professional civil servant—he had
been taken over from the old Political Police into the new one, and
he was one of those officials who were forced into it—I asked him,
“Tell me, am I in a police office here or in a robber’s den?” The
answer I received was, “You are in a robber’s den and you can
expect to see much more yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Under whom was the Political Police at
that time and who was the superior authority?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The Political Police was under one Rudolf Diels. He,
too, came from the old Prussian Political Police. He was a professional
civil servant, and one might have expected him still to retain
the ideas of law and decency: but in a brutal and cynical way he
set his mind on making the new rulers forget his political past as a
democrat and on ingratiating himself with his superior, the Prussian
Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Göring. It was Diels
who created the Gestapo office; he suggested to Göring the issue of
the first decree for making that office independent. It was Diels
who let the SA and the SS enter that office; he legalized the actions
of these civil Kommandos. But soon it became evident to me that
such a bourgeois renegade could not do so much wrong quite by
himself. Some very important person must have been backing him;
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
in fact, I very quickly saw also that somebody was taking a daily
interest in everything that happened in that office. Reports were
written; telephone inquiries were received. Diels went several times
daily to give reports, and it was the Prussian Minister of the Interior
Göring who considered this Secret State Police as his special
preserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During those months nothing happened in this office which was
not known or ordered by Göring personally. I want to stress this,
because in the course of years the public formed a different idea of
Göring because he noticeably retired from his official functions. At
that time, it was not yet the Göring who finally suffocated, in his
Karinhall. It was the Göring who looked after everything personally
and had not yet begun to busy himself with the building of
Karinhall or to don all sorts of uniforms and decorations. It was
Göring still in civilian clothes, who was the real chief of an office,
who inspired it, and who attached importance to being the “iron”
Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, I believe you can describe some
points more concisely. As to what you have just said, do you know
this from your own experience, or where did you learn of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I not only heard and saw it myself, but I also learned
much from a man who in those days was also a member of the
Secret State Police, and whose information will play an important
part in the course of my statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time a criminologist had been called into the Secret State
Police, probably the best known expert of the Prussian police, Oberregierungsrat
Nebe. Nebe was a National Socialist. He had been in
opposition to the former Prussian police and had joined the National
Socialist Party. He was a man who sincerely believed in the purity
and genuineness of the National Socialist aims. Thus I saw for
myself how this man found out on the spot what was actually going
on and how he inwardly recoiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can also state here, as it is important, the reasons why Nebe
became a strong opponent, who went with the opposition up to
20 July and later suffered death by hanging. At that time, in
August 1933, Nebe was ordered by the Defendant Göring to murder
Gregor Strasser, formerly a leading member of the National
Socialist Party, by means of a car or hunting accident. Nebe was
so shocked at this order that he refused to carry it out and made
an inquiry at the Reich Chancellery. The answer from the Reich
Chancellery was that the Führer knew nothing of this order. Thereupon
Nebe was summoned to Göring, who reproached him most
bitterly for having made an inquiry. Nevertheless, when he
finished these reproaches he considered it advisable to promote him,
because he thought he would thereby silence him.
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The second thing which happened at that time, and which is
also very important, was that the Defendant Göring gave the
Political Police so-called open warrants for murder. At that time
there were not only so-called amnesty laws which gave amnesty
for infamous actions, but there was also a special law according
to which investigations, already initiated by police authorities and
by the public prosecutor, could be quashed, on condition, however,
that in these special cases the Reich Chancellor, or Göring, personally
signed the pertinent order. Göring made use of this law by
giving open warrants to the Chief of the Gestapo, with which all
that had to be done was to fill in the names of those who were to
be murdered. Nebe was so shocked by this that from that moment
on he felt it his duty to fight against the Gestapo. At our request
he remained with us there, and afterwards in the Criminal Police,
because we needed one man at least who could keep us informed
about police conditions in case our desire for a revolution should
materialize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, what did you do yourself when
you saw all these things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I, for my part, tried to contact those bourgeois circles
which through my connections were open to me. I went to various
ministries: to the Prussian Ministry of the Interior, to State Secretary
Grauert, and several ministerial directors and counsellors. I
went to the Reich Ministry of the Interior, to the Ministry of Justice,
to the Foreign Office, and the Ministry of War. I spoke repeatedly
to the Chief of the Army High Command, Colonel General Von
Hammerstein. Among all these connections I formed at that time,
there is one other who is particularly important for my testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time I met in the newly formed intelligence department
of the OKW a Major Oster. I gave him all the material which by
then had already accumulated. We started a collection—which we
continued until 20 July—of all the documents we could get hold of;
and Oster was the man who from then on, in the Ministry of War
never failed to warn every officer he could contact officially or
privately. In course of time, by favor of Admiral Canaris, Oster
became Chief of Staff of the Intelligence. When he met his death
by hanging he was a general. But I consider it my duty to testify
here, in view of all this man has done—his unforgettable fight
against the Gestapo and against all the crimes which were committed
against humanity and peace—that among the inflation of
German field marshals and generals there was one real German
general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: How did the work develop, according to
your observations in the Gestapo?
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At that time conditions in Germany were still such
that people kept their eyes open in the ministries. There was still
an opposition in the bourgeois ministries; there was still the Reich
President Von Hindenburg. Thus, at the end of October 1933 the
Defendant Göring was forced to dismiss Diels, the Chief of the State
Police. At the same time a commission of investigation was set up
in order to re-organize that institution thoroughly. According to
the ministerial decree, Nebe and I were members of that commission.
But that commission never met, for the Defendant Göring
found ways and means to thwart this measure. He appointed as
Chief and successor of Diels a still worse Nazi named Hinkler, who
some time before had been acquitted in a trial because of irresponsibility;
and this Hinkler acted in such a way that before 30 days
had passed he was dismissed. Then the Defendant Göring was able
to restore his Diels to the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Do you know anything of the events
which led to the Prussian law of 30 November 1933, by which the
functions of the Gestapo were taken away from the office of the
Minister of the Interior and transferred to the office of the Prussian
Prime Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was just the moment of which I am speaking.
Göring realized that it would not serve his purpose if other
ministries were too much concerned in his Secret State Police.
Though he was Prussian Minister of the Interior himself, he was
disturbed by the fact that the police department of the Prussian
Ministry of the Interior could look into the affairs of his private
domain; and so he separated the Secret State Police from the
remaining police and placed it under his personal direction, thereby
excluding all other police authorities. From the point of view of
a proper police system this was nonsense, because you cannot run
a Political Police properly if you separate it from the Criminal
Police and the Order Police. But Göring knew why he did not want
any other police authority to look into the affairs of the Secret State
Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, did you remain in the police
service yourself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: On that day when Göring carried out his little—and
I can’t find another word for it—<span class='it'>coup d’état</span> by assigning to
himself a state police of his own, this Secret State Police issued a
warrant of arrest against me. I had expected this and had gone
into hiding. The next morning I went to the Chief of the Police
Department of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior, Ministerial
Director Daluege—who was a high SS general—and said that it was
really not quite in order to issue a warrant of arrest against me.
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A criminal commissioner of the Secret State Police came to
arrest me in the room of the Chief of the Prussian police. Daluege
was kind enough to allow me to escape through a back door to
State Secretary Grauert. Grauert intervened with Göring, and as
always in cases of this kind, Göring was very surprised and ordered
a thorough investigation. That was the usual way of saying that
such incidents were to be pigeonholed. After that I was no longer
allowed to enter the Secret State Police, but I was sent as an
observer to the Reichstag Fire trial at Leipzig, which was just
drawing to an end. During these last days of November I was able
to get some insight into this obscure affair and having already tried,
together with Nebe, to investigate this crime, I was able to add to
my knowledge here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I assume that I shall again be questioned about that point and,
therefore, shall now confine myself to the statement that, if necessary,
I am prepared to refresh Defendant Göring’s memory concerning
his complicity in and his joint knowledge of this first
“brown” <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> and the murder of the accomplices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: On 1 May 1934 Frick became Prussian
Minister of the Interior. Did you get into touch with Frick himself
or his ministries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. Immediately after the Reichstag Fire trial was
over—that is, at the end of 1933—I was dismissed from the police
service and transferred to a Landrat office in East Prussia. I complained,
however, to State Secretary Grauert about this obvious
disciplinary punishment. As he and Ministerial Director Daluege
knew of my quarrel with the Secret State Police, they got me into
the Ministry of the Interior and assigned to me the task of collecting
all those reports which were still being incorrectly addressed
to the Ministry of the Interior and of forwarding them to the
Prussian Prime Minister who was in charge of the Secret State
Police and who dealt with these matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as Göring found out about this he repeatedly protested
against my presence in the Ministry, but the Minister of the Interior
was adamant and I succeeded in keeping that post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Frick came I did not get in touch with him immediately
as I was only a subordinate official. I assume, however, that the
Defendant Frick knew about my activity and my views, because I
was now encouraged to continue collecting all those requests for
help which were wrongly addressed to the Ministry of the Interior,
and a large number of these reports I submitted through official
channels to Daluege, Grauert, and Frick. There was, however, the
difficulty that Göring, in his capacity of Prime Minister of Prussia,
had prohibited Frick, as his Prussian Minister of the Interior, to
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
take cognizance of such reports. Frick was supposed to forward
them to the Gestapo without comment. I saw no reason for not
submitting them to Frick all the same, and as Frick was also Reich
Minister of the Interior—and in this capacity could give directives
to the Länder and, therefore, also to Göring—he took cognizance
of these reports in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and allowed
me to forward them to Göring with the request for a report.
Göring protested repeatedly, and I know this resulted in heated
disputes between him and Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Is anything known to you about the
fact that at that time the Reich Minister of the Interior issued
certain directives to restrict protective custody?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It is correct that at that time a number of such
directives were issued, and the fact that I say that a number of
such directives were issued already implies that generally they
were not complied with by subordinate authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Minister of the Interior was a minister with no
personal executive power, and I will never forget the impression
it made on me, while training as a civil servant, that we officials
in the Secret State Police were instructed in principle not to
answer any inquiries from the Reich Ministry of the Interior.
Naturally, at intervals the Reich Minister of the Interior sent
reminders, and the efficiency of a Gestapo official was judged by
the number of such reminders he could show his chief, Diels, as
proof that he did not pay any attention to such matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: On 30 June 1934 the so-called Röhm
Putsch took place. Can you give a short description of the conditions
prevailing before this Putsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: First I have to say that there never was a Röhm
Putsch. On 30 June there was only a Göring-Himmler Putsch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am in a position to give some information about that dark
chapter, because I dealt with and followed up this case in the
Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior, and because the
radiograms sent during these days by Göring and Himmler to the
police authorities of the Reich came into my hands. The last of
these radiograms reads: “By order of Göring all documents relating
to 30 June shall be burned immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time I took the liberty of putting these papers into my
safe, and to this day I do not know whether or not they survived
Kaltenbrunner’s attempts to get them. I still hope to recover these
papers, and if I do, I can prove that throughout the whole 30 June
not a single shot was fired by the SA. The SA did not revolt. By
this, however, I do not wish to utter a single word of excuse for the
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
leaders of the SA. On 30 June not one of the SA leaders died who
did not deserve death a hundred times—but after a proper trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation on that 30 June was that of a civil war; on one
side were the SA headed by Röhm, and on the other side, Göring and
Himmler. It had been arranged for the SA, several days before
30 June, to be sent on leave. The SA leaders had been purposely
called by Hitler for a conference at Wiessee that 30 June, and it
is not usual for people who intend to effect a <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> to travel
by sleeping car to a conference. To their surprise they were seized
at the station and at once driven off to execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called Munich Putsch took place as follows: The Munich
SA did not come into it at all, and at 1 hour’s driving distance
from Munich the alleged traitors, Röhm and Heines, fell into the
sleep of death completely ignorant of the fact that, according to
Hitler and Göring, a revolt had taken place in Munich the previous
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was able to observe the Putsch in Berlin very closely. It took
place without anything being known about it by the public and
without any participation by the SA. We in the police were unaware
of it. It is true, however, that 4 days before 30 June one of the
alleged ringleaders, SA Gruppenführer Karl Ernst of Berlin, came
to Ministerial Director Daluege looking very concerned and said
that there were rumors going round in Berlin that the SA were
contemplating a Putsch. He asked for an interview with Minister
of the Interior Frick, so that he, Ernst, could assure him that there
was no such intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daluege sent me with this message to the Defendant Frick, and
I arranged for this strange conversation where an SA leader assured
the Minister of the Interior that he did not intend to stage a Putsch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernst then set out on a pleasure trip to Madeira. On 30 June he
was taken from the steamer and sent to Berlin for execution. I
saw him arrive at the Tempelhof airport. This struck me as particularly
interesting, because a few hours before I had read the
official report about his execution in the newspaper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, then, was the so-called SA and Röhm Putsch. And because
I am not to withhold anything, I must add that I was present when
on 30 June the Defendant Göring informed the press of the event.
On this occasion the Defendant Göring made the cold-blooded
remark that he had for days been waiting for a code word which
he had arranged with Hitler. He had then struck, of course with
lightning speed, and had also extended the scope of his mission.
This extension of his mission caused the death of a large number
of innocent people. To mention only a few, there were Generals
Schleicher—who was killed together with his wife—and Von Bredow,
Ministerial Director Klausner, Edgar Jung, and many others.
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, you were in the Ministry of
the Interior yourself at that time. How did Frick hear about these
measures, and was he himself in any way involved in the quelling
of this so-called Putsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I was present when, at about half past 9, Ministerial
Director Daluege came back quite pale after seeing Göring and
having just been told what had happened. Daluege and I went to
Grauert and we drove to the Reich Ministry of the Interior, to Frick.
Frick rushed out of the room—it may have been about 10 o’clock—in
order to go to Göring to find out what had happened in the
meantime, only to be told that he, as Police Minister of the Reich,
should go home now and not worry about further developments. In
fact, Frick did go home, and during those 2 dramatic days he did
not enter the ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once during this time Daluege drove over with me to see him.
For the rest, it was given to me, the youngest official of the Reich
Ministry of the Interior, to inform the Reich Minister of the Interior
on that bloody Saturday and Sunday of the atrocious things
which in the meantime had happened in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, you just told us of an instruction
Frick had received not to worry about these things. Who gave
him this instruction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As far as I know, Göring gave or conveyed to him
an instruction by Hitler. I do not know whether there was a
written instruction; neither do I know whether Frick had asked
about it. I should think that Frick, on that day, probably considered
it would be wise not to ask too many awkward questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: After these things had been concluded,
did Frick in any way attempt to smooth matters over?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: To answer this question correctly I have to say first
that on Saturday, 30 June, we at the Ministry of the Interior knew
very little about what had happened. On Sunday, 1 July, we
learned much more, and after these bloody days had passed, there
is no doubt that Frick had on the whole a clear idea of what had
happened. Also, during these days he made no secret of his indignation
at the murders and unlawful arrests which apparently
had taken place. In order to stick to the truth I have to answer
your question by saying that the first reaction of the Defendant
Frick which I knew about was that Reich law in which the
Reich Ministers declared the events of June 30 to be lawful. This
law had an unprecedented psychological effect on the further developments
in Germany, and it has its place in the history of
German terror. Apart from this, many things happened in the
Third Reich which a normal mortal could not understand, but which
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
were well understood in the circles of ministers and state secretaries.
And so, I have to admit that, after that law, the Defendant
Frick made a serious attempt to remedy at least the most obvious
abuses. Maybe he thought other ministers in the Reich Cabinet
should have spoken sooner. I am thinking now of Reich War Minister
Von Blomberg, two of whose generals were shot, and who, in spite
of that, signed this law. I intentionally mention Blomberg’s name,
and ask to be permitted to pause here to tell the Tribunal about
an incident which occurred this morning. I was in the room of the
defendants’ counsel and was speaking to Dr. Dix. Dr. Dix was interrupted
by Dr. Stahmer, counsel for Göring. I heard what
Dr. Stahmer told Dr. Dix...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO STAHMER (Counsel for Defendant Göring): May I
ask whether a personal conversation which I had with Dr. Dix has
anything to do with the taking of evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I am not speaking...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, don’t go on with your evidence
whilst the objection is being made. Yes, Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: If you please. I didn’t understand...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I do not know whether it is in order when giving
evidence to reveal a conversation which I had with Dr. Dix in the
Defense Counsel’s room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: May I say something to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you kindly keep silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: May I finish my statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you keep silent, sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: This morning in the room of the Defense
Counsel, I had a personal conversation with Dr. Dix concerning the
Blomberg case. That conversation was not intended to be heard by
the witness. I do not know the witness; I didn’t even see the witness,
as far as I can remember, and I don’t know whether this
should come into the evidence by making such a conversation public
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: This incident has been reported to
me, and I think it is important that this Tribunal know the influence—the
threats that were made at this witness in this courthouse
while waiting to testify here, threats not only against him but
against the Defendant Schacht. Now, the affair was reported to me.
I think it is important that this Tribunal know it. I think it is
important that it come out. I should have attempted to bring it out
on cross-examination if it had not been told, and I think that the
witness should be permitted. These other parties have had great
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
latitude here. This witness has been subjected to threats, as I understand
it, which were uttered in his presence, whether they were
intended for him or not, and I ask that this Tribunal allow
Dr. Gisevius, who is the one representative of democratic forces in
Germany, to take this stand to tell his story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal would like to hear
first of all anything further you have to say upon the matter. They
will then hear what Dr. Dix has to say, if he wishes to say anything;
and they will then hear whether the witness himself wishes to say
anything in answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no qualms about telling the Court exactly
what I said. Last night I discussed the case with the Defendant
Göring and told him the witness Gisevius...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We don’t want to hear any communications
which you had with the Defendant Göring other than those you
choose to make in support of your objection to this evidence that
has been given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Mr. President; but I must say briefly that
Göring told me that it was of no interest to him if the witness
Gisevius did incriminate him, but that he did not want Blomberg,
who died recently—and I assumed it was only the question of Blomberg’s
marriage—he, Göring, did not want these facts concerning
the marriage of Blomberg to be discussed here in public. If that
could not be prevented, then of course Göring, in his turn—and it is
only a question of Schacht, because Schacht, as he had told me,
wanted to speak about these things—then he, Göring would not
spare Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is what I told Dr. Dix this morning, and I am sure Dr. Dix
will confirm that, and if I may add...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will hear you in a moment, Dr. Dix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I said—and I was not referring to Schacht, to
the witness, or to Herr Pannenbecker—I said, for reasons of professional
etiquette, that I should like to inform Dr. Dix. That is
what I said and what I did. In any case I did not even know that
the witness Gisevius was present at that moment. At any rate, it
was not intended for him. Moreover, I was speaking to Dr. Dix
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: So that I may understand what you are
saying: You say you had told Dr. Dix the substance of the conversation
you had had with the Defendant Göring, and said that
Göring would withdraw his objection to the facts being given if the
Defendant Schacht wanted them to be given. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No, I only said that Göring did not care what
was said about himself; he merely wanted the deceased Blomberg
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
to be spared, and he did not want things concerning Blomberg’s
marriage to be discussed. If Schacht did not prevent that—I was
speaking only of Schacht—then he, Göring, in his turn, would have
no consideration for Schacht—would no longer have any consideration
for Schacht. That is what I told Dr. Dix for reasons of personal
etiquette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, I can’t hear you. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: As I said, that is what I told Dr. Dix, and that
finished the conversation. And I made it quite clear to Dr. Dix that
I told him that only as one colleague to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. That is all you wish to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I remember the facts, I believe, correctly and reliably,
as follows: This morning I was in the room of the Defense Counsel
speaking to the witness Dr. Gisevius. I believe my colleague, Professor
Kraus, was also taking part in the conversation. Then my
colleague, Stahmer, approached me and said he would like to speak
to me. I replied that at the moment I was having an important and
urgent conversation with Gisevius, and asked whether it could wait.
Stahmer said “no,” and that he must speak to me at once. I then
took my colleague Stahmer aside, probably five or six paces from
the group with whom I had been speaking. My colleague Stahmer
told me the following—it is quite possible, I don’t remember the
actual words he used, that he started by saying that he was telling
me this for professional reasons, as one colleague to another. If he
says so now, I am sure that it is so. Anyhow I don’t remember that
any longer. He said to me, “Listen, Göring has an idea that Gisevius
will attack him as much as he can. If he attacks the dead Blomberg,
however, then Göring will disclose everything against Schacht—and
he knows lots of things about Schacht which may not be pleasant for
Schacht. He, Göring, had been very reticent in his testimony; but if
anything should be said against the dead Blomberg, then he would
have to reveal things against Schacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what he meant—that he would bring things up against
Schacht. That was the conversation. I cannot say with absolute
certainty whether my colleague told me I should call Gisevius’
attention to it. If he says he did not say so, then it is certainly true,
and I believe him; but I could only interpret that information to
mean that I should notify Gisevius of this development promised by
Göring. I therefore thought—and did not have the slightest doubt—that
I was voicing Göring’s intention, and that I was acting as
Dr. Stahmer wished, and that that was the purpose of the whole
thing. What else could be the reason for Dr. Stahmer’s telling me
at that moment, immediately before my discussion with Gisevius,
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
even while I was in conversation with Gisevius, that he could not
wait, that I must break off my conversation? Why should he inform
me at that time, unless he meant that the mischief hinted at and
threatened by Göring might possibly be avoided—in other words,
that the witness Gisevius, on whom everything depended, should
think twice before making his statement? I did not have the slightest
doubt that what Stahmer meant by his words to me was that I
should convey them to Gisevius. As I said, even if Stahmer had not
asked me—and he was certainly speaking the truth when he said
he did not ask me to take action—I would have replied, if I had
been questioned before he made this statement, and that probably
with an equally good conscience, that he had asked me to pass it on
to Gisevius. But I will not maintain that he actually used those
words. Anyway, it is absolutely certain that this conversation did
take place, and it was in the firm belief that I was acting as
Dr. Stahmer and Göring intended that I went straight to Gisevius.
He was standing only five or six steps away from me, or even
nearer. I think I understood him to say, when I addressed him, that
he had heard parts of it. I don’t know whether I understood him
correctly. I then informed him of the gist of this conversation. That
is what happened early this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: May I say the following: It goes without saying,
that I neither asked Dr. Dix to pass it on to Gisevius, nor did I count
upon his doing so; but I surmised that Gisevius would be examined
this morning, and that Dr. Dix would question the witness concerning
the circumstances of Blomberg’s marriage. That is what I
had been told previously—namely, that Dr. Dix intended to put this
question to the witness. Therefore, I called Dr. Dix’s attention to it,
assuming that he would abstain from such a question concerning
Blomberg’s marriage. That was not intended for the witness in any
way, and I know definitely that I said to Dr. Dix that I was telling
him this merely as one colleague to another, and he thanked me for
it. He said, “Thank you very much.” At any rate, if he had said to
me, “I am going to tell the witness,” I would have said immediately,
“For heaven’s sake; that is information intended only for you
personally.” Indeed, I am really surprised that Dr. Dix has in this
manner abused the confidence which I placed in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, we have heard the facts, and
we do not think we need hear anything more about it beyond
considering the question as to whether the witness is to go on with
his evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, has the explanation which has been given by Dr. Stahmer
and Dr. Dix sufficiently covered the matters with which you were
proposing to deal with reference to Field Marshal Von Blomberg?
Is there anything further that you need say about it?
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I beg your pardon. Perhaps I did not quite understand
the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning Blomberg, at this point I did not want to say
anything further; I merely wanted, on the first occasion that Blomberg’s
name came up, to make it clear that the whole thing gave me
the feeling that I was under pressure. I was standing so near that I
could not help hearing what Dr. Stahmer said, and the manner in
which Dr. Dix told me about it—for I had heard at least half of it—could
not be understood in any other way than to mean that Dr. Dix
in a very loyal manner was instructing me, a witness for the
Defendant Schacht, to be rather reticent in my testimony on a point
which I consider very important. That point will come up later and
has nothing whatsoever to do with the marriage of Herr Von Blomberg.
It has to do with the part which the Defendant Göring played
in it, and I know quite well why Göring does not want me to speak
about that affair. To my thinking, it is the most corrupt thing
Göring ever did, and Göring is just using the cloak of chivalry by
pretending that he wants to protect a dead man, whereas he really
wants to prevent me from testifying in full on an important point—that
is, the Fritsch crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Turning to Dr. Pannenbecker.</span>] The Tribunal
will hear the evidence then, whatever evidence you wish the
witness to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I beg your pardon. What I have to say in connection
with the Blomberg case is finished. I merely wanted to protest at
the first opportunity when the name was mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well then, counsel will continue his examination
and you will give such evidence as is relevant when you are
examined or cross-examined by Dr. Dix on behalf of the Defendant
Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, after the events of 30 June 1934,
had the position of the Gestapo become so strong that no measures
against it had any chance of succeeding?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I must answer this in the negative. The Secret State
Police doubtlessly gained in power after 30 June, but because of the
many excesses committed on 30 June, the opposition in the various
ministries against the Secret State Police had become so strong that
through collective action the majority of ministers could have used
the events of 30 June to eliminate the Secret State Police. I personally
made repeated efforts in that direction. With the knowledge of
the Defendant Frick I went to see the Minister of Justice Gürtner
and begged him many times to use the large number of illegal
murders as a reason for action against the Secret State Police. I
personally went to Von Reichenau also, who was Chief of the Armed
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
Forces Offices at that time, and told him the same thing. I know
that my friend Oster brought the files concerning this matter to the
knowledge of Blomberg, and I wish to testify here that, in spite of
the excesses of the 30 of June, it would have been quite possible at
that time to return to law and order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: After that, what did the Reich Minister
of the Interior do—that is, what did Frick do to steer the Secret
State Police to a course of legality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We started a struggle against the Secret State Police
and tried at least to prevent Himmler from getting into the Reich
Ministry of the Interior. Shortly before Göring had relinquished
the Ministry of the Interior to Frick, he had made Himmler Chief of
the Secret State Police in Prussia. Himmler, starting from that basis
of power, had attempted to assume police power in the other Länder
of the Reich. Frick tried to prevent that by taking the stand that
he, as Reich Minister of the Interior, had an equal voice in appointing
police functionaries in the Reich. At the same time, we tried to
prevent an increase in the numbers of the Secret State Police by
systematically refusing all requests by the Gestapo to increase its
body of officials. Unfortunately here also, as always, Himmler found
ways and means to overcome this. He went to the finance ministers
of the individual states and told them that he needed funds for the
guard troops of the concentration camps, for the so-called “Death’s-Head”
units, and he drew up a scale whereby five SS men were to
guard one prisoner. With these funds Himmler financed his Secret
State Police, as, of course it rested with him how many men he
wanted to imprison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other ways too, we in the Reich Ministry of the Interior
attempted by all possible means to block the way of the Gestapo;
but unfortunately, the numerous requests we sent to the Gestapo
remained unanswered. Again it was Göring who forbade Himmler
to answer and who protected Himmler when he refused to give any
information in reply to our inquiries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, a last effort was made during my term of office in the
Reich Ministry of the Interior. We tried to paralyze the Secret State
Police at least to some extent by introducing into protective custody
the right of supervision and complaint. If we could have achieved
the right of review of all cases of protective custody, we would also
have been able to get an insight into the individual actions of the
Gestapo. A law was formulated, and this law was first submitted to
the Ministerial Council of Prussia, the largest of the states. Again
it was the Defendant Göring who, by all available means, opposed
the passing of such a law. A very stormy cabinet meeting on the
matter ended with my being asked to leave the Ministry of the
Interior.
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, I have shown you a memorandum...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This will be a convenient time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, the Tribunal wishes me
to say that it anticipates that you will put any questions which you
think necessary with reference to the alleged intimidation of the
witness when you come to cross-examine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, Sir; thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, I should like to talk about the
efforts which were made by the Ministry of the Interior to stop the
arbitrary methods of the Gestapo, particularly with reference to the
concentration camps. I therefore ask you to look at a memorandum
which originates from the Reich and Prussian Ministry of the
Interior. It is Document 775-PS, which I submitted this morning as
Exhibit Frick-9 when I presented the evidence for Frick. It is
Number 34 in the document book. Do you know that memorandum?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I don’t. It appears that this memorandum was
drawn up after I had left the Ministry of the Interior. I assume this
from the fact that in this memorandum the Reich Minister of the
Interior appears to have already given up the fight, since he writes
that as a matter of principle it should be made clear who bears the
responsibility, and, if necessary, the responsibility for all the consequences
must now—and I quote—“be borne by the Reichsführer
SS who, in fact, has already claimed for himself the leadership of
the Political Police in the Reich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time when I was at the Reich Ministry of the Interior, we
tried particularly to prevent this from happening—namely, that
Himmler should take over the Political Police. This is evidently a
memorandum written about 6 months later when the terror had
become still greater. The facts which are quoted here are known
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Can you say anything about this? Does
it not deal with the Pünder case and the case of Esterwege,
Oldenburg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The Esterwege case can be told most briefly. It is
one of many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as I can recollect, an SA or local group leader was arrested
by the Gestapo because he got excited about the conditions in the
Papenburg concentration camp. This was not the first time either.
I don’t know why the Defendant Frick picked on this particular
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
case. Nevertheless, one day Daluege showed me one of those customary
handwritten slips sent by Frick to Himmler. Frick had
written to Himmler in the margin in large green letters that an SA
man or local group leader, or whatever he was, had been arrested
illegally, that this man must be released at once, and that if
Himmler did that sort of thing again he, Frick, would institute
criminal proceedings against Himmler for illegal detention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember this story very well, because it was somewhat peculiar—considering
the police conditions which existed at the time—that
Himmler should be threatened by Frick with criminal proceedings,
and Daluege made some sneering remarks to me regarding
Frick’s action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the one case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What was the date?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: This must have happened in the spring of 1935, I
should say in March or April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, do you know how Himmler
reacted to that threat of criminal proceedings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. There was a second case. That is this Pünder
affair which is mentioned here. He reacted similarly to both, and
therefore it might be better if I first relate the Pünder affair in this
connection. It concerned a Berlin attorney, who was a lawyer of
high standing and legal adviser to the Swedish Embassy. The
widow of the Ministerial Director Klausner, who had been murdered
on 30 June, approached Pünder, as she wanted to sue the life
insurance companies for payment of her annuity. But as Klausner
had allegedly committed suicide on that day, no director of any
insurance company dared pay the money to the widow. Consequently,
the attorney had to sue. But the Nazis had made a law
according to which all such awkward cases—awkward for the
Nazis—were not to be tried in court: they were to be taken to a
so-called Spruchkammer in the Reich Ministry of the Interior. If I
am not mistaken, this law was called “Law for the Settlement of
Civilian Claims.” They were never at a loss for fine-sounding names
and titles at that time. This law forced the attorney to submit his
claim to the court first. He was apprehensive. He went to the
Ministry of the Interior and told the State Secretary, “If I comply
with the law and sue, I shall be arrested.” The State Secretary in
the Ministry of the Interior forced him to sue. Thereupon the very
wise attorney went to the Ministry of Justice and told State Secretary
Freisler that he did not want to sue as he would certainly
be arrested by the Gestapo. The Secretary in the Ministry of Justice
informed him that he would have to send in a claim in any case,
but that nothing would happen as the courts had been instructed to
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
pass such cases on without comment to the Spruchkammer in the
Ministry of the Interior. Thereupon, the attorney sued and the
Gestapo promptly arrested him for slander because he had stated
that the Ministerial Director Klausner had not met his death by
suicide. This was for us a classical example of what we had come
to in Germany as far as protective custody was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had taken the liberty of selecting this case from among
hundreds, or I should say thousands of similar cases and of suggesting
to Frick that this matter should be brought to the notice not
only of Göring, but of Hitler as well this time. Then I sat down and
drafted a letter or a report from Frick to Hitler, which also went to
the Ministry of Justice. There were more than five pages, and I
discussed from every angle the facts concerning Ministerial Director
Klausner’s suicide, with the assistance of the SS, and the ensuing
lawsuit. This report to Hitler concluded with Frick’s remark that
the time had now come to have the problem of protective custody
settled by the Reich and by lawful means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I answer your question regarding what happened. It
roughly coincided with Frick’s letter to Himmler regarding deprivation
of liberty. Himmler took these two letters to a meeting
of Reichsleiter, that is, the so-called ministers of the movement, and
he put the question to them, whether it was proper to allow one
Reichsleiter, namely Frick, to write such letters to another Reichsleiter,
that is, to Himmler. These worthy gentlemen answered this
question in the negative and reprimanded Frick. Then Himmler
went to the meeting of the Prussian cabinet where the protective
custody law, which I mentioned, was being discussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps I may draw your attention to the fact that at that time
it was a rare thing for Himmler to be allowed to attend a meeting
of Prussian ministers. There was a time in Germany—and it was
quite a long period—when Himmler was not the powerful man
which he afterwards became because the bourgeois ministers and
the generals were cowards and gave way to him. Thus, it was a
rare thing for Himmler to be allowed to attend a meeting of the
Prussian Ministerial Council at all, and that particular meeting
ended by my being discharged from the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, I should like to quote to you
two sentences from the memorandum which I have just shown to
you—that is, 775-PS—and ask you to tell me whether the facts are
stated correctly. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In this connection, I draw your attention to the case of the
attorney Pünder, who was taken into protective custody together
with his colleagues, merely because, after making
inquiry at the Reich Ministry of the Interior and at our
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
ministry, he had filed a suit, which he was obliged to do
under a Reich law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: And then the other sentence. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I mention here only the case of a teacher and Kreisleiter at
Esterwege who was kept in protective custody for 8 days
because...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Pannenbecker, where is that sentence
which you have just read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: In the Frick Document Book under
Number 34, second sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which page?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: In my Document Book it is Page 80.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you speaking of Paragraph 3 on Page 70?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: No, Mr. President, I have just discovered
that this particular sentence in the document has not been
translated. Perhaps I may read one more sentence which apparently
has been translated. It can be found in Paragraph 3 of the same
document.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I mention here only the case of a teacher and Kreisleiter
at Esterwege who was kept in protective custody for 8 days
because, as it turned out afterwards, he had sent a correct
report to the head of his district concerning abuses by
the SS.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that corresponds to the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, did you yourself have any support
from Frick for your personal protection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. At that time, of course, I was such a suspect
in the eyes of the Secret State Police that all sorts of evil designs
were being made against me. Frick gave an order, therefore, that
I should be protected in my home by the local police. A direct
telephone from my home to the police station was installed, and I
had only to pick up the receiver and someone at least would know
in case I had surprise visitors. Furthermore, the Gestapo used
their usual methods against me by accusing me of criminal acts.
Apparently the files were taken to Hitler in the Reich Chancellery,
and Frick intervened, and it was soon discovered that this concerned
a namesake of mine! Frick said quite openly on the telephone
that these fellows—as he put it—had once more lied to the
Führer. This was the signal for the Gestapo, who were, of course,
listening in on this telephone conversation, that they could no
longer use these methods.
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we advanced one step further through Heydrich. He was
so kind as to inform me by telephone that I probably had forgotten
that he could pursue his personal and political opponents to their
very graves. I made an official report of that threat to Frick, and
Frick, either personally or through Daluege, intervened with
Heydrich, and there is no doubt that he thereby rendered me a
considerable service, for Heydrich never liked it very much when
his murderous intentions were talked about openly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, would then, at least a minister
of the Reich have no cause for alarm about his own personal safety
if he tried to fight against the terror of the Gestapo and Himmler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: If you ask me that now, I must say that Schacht
was the only one who was put into a concentration camp. But it is
true that we all asked ourselves just how long it would take for a
Reich Minister to be sent to a concentration camp. As regards
Frick, he told me confidentially, as far back as 1934, that the Reich
Governor of Bavaria had given him reliable information, according
to which he was to be murdered while taking a holiday in the
country, in Bavaria, and he asked me whether I could find out any
details. At that time I went with my friend Nebe to Bavaria by
car, and we made a secret investigation which, at any rate, proved
that such plans had been discussed. But, as I said, Frick survived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. RUDOLF DIX (Counsel for Defendant Schacht): May I ask
you to decide on the following question? I have called Gisevius. He
is a witness called by me, and this is, therefore, not a subsequent
question which I am putting, but I am examining him as my
witness. I am of the opinion, therefore, that it is right and expedient
that I should now follow up the examination by my colleague
Pannenbecker, and that my other colleagues who also want
to put questions follow the two of us. I ask the Tribunal to decide
on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you the only defendants’ counsel who
asked for this witness to be called on behalf of your client?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I called him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I know; but are you the only defendants’
counsel who asked to call him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I believe, Sir, I am the only one who has called him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, Dr. Dix, you may examine him
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Gisevius, Dr. Pannenbecker has already mentioned
the fact that you have published a book entitled <span class='it'>To the Bitter End</span>.
I have submitted quotations from that book to the Tribunal as
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
evidence, and they have been accepted as documentary evidence by
the Tribunal. For this reason I now ask you: Are the contents of
that book historically true; did you write it only from memory, or
is it based on notes which you made at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I can say here to the best of my knowledge, and
with a good conscience, that the contents of the book are historically
true. In Germany I always made personal notes as far as it was
possible. I have said here that my dead friend Oster had in the
War Ministry a considerable collection of documents to which I
had access at all times. In writing about any important matter in
which I made reference to friends in the opposition group, I never
did so without having first consulted them many times about it.
And since 1938 I have been in Switzerland, first as a visitor and
later on for professional reasons, and there I was able to continue
my notes undisturbed. The volume which has been submitted to
the Tribunal was practically completed in 1941, and in 1942 had
already been shown to several friends of mine abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If he says that the book is true, that is
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Since when have you known the Defendant Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I have known the Defendant Schacht since the end
of 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: On what occasion and in what circumstances did you
meet him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I met him when I worked in the Reich Ministry of
the Interior and was collecting material against the Gestapo. I
was consulted by various parties, who either feared trouble with
the Gestapo or who had had trouble. Thus, one day Schacht, who
was then Minister for Economy, sent a man to me whom he trusted—it
was his plenipotentiary Herbert Göring—to ask me whether
I would help Schacht. He, Schacht, had for some time felt that he
was being watched by Himmler and the Gestapo and lately had
had good reason to suspect that an informer, or at least a microphone,
had been installed in his own house. I was asked whether
I could help in this case. I agreed to do so and, with a microphone
expert from the Reich post administration, on the following morning
I visited Schacht’s ministerial residence. We went with the microphone
expert from room to room and—did not have to search very
long. It had been done very badly by the Gestapo. They had
mounted the microphone all too visibly and, moreover, had engaged
a domestic servant to spy on Schacht. She had a listening device
attached to the house telephone installed in her own bedroom,
which was easy to discover, and so we were able to unmask the
whole thing. It was on that occasion that I first spoke to Schacht.
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And what was the subject of your conversation? Did
you at that time already speak about political matters to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We spoke about the matters and the somewhat
peculiar situation which had brought us together. Schacht knew
that I was very active in opposing the Gestapo, and I, for my part,
was aware that Schacht was known for his utterances against the
SS and the Gestapo on numberless occasions. Many middle class
people in Germany placed their hopes in him as the only strong
minister who could protect them if need be. Particularly the industrialists
and business men, who were very important at the time,
hoped for, and often found his support. So that it was quite natural
that immediately during the first conversation I told him everything
that was troubling me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main problem at that time was the removal of the Gestapo
and the removal of the Nazi regime. Therefore our conversation
was highly political, and Schacht listened to everything with an
open mind, which made it possible for me to tell him everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And what did he say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I told Schacht that we were inevitably drifting
towards radicalism, and that it was doubtful whether, the way
things were going, the end of the present course would not be
inflation, and, that being so, whether it would not be better if he
himself were to bring about that inflation. That would enable him
to know beforehand the exact date of such a crisis, and together
with the generals and anti-radical ministers make timely arrangements
to meet the situation when it became really serious. I said
to him, “You should bring about that inflation; you yourself will
then be able to determine the course of events instead of allowing
others to take things out of your hands.” He replied, “You see,
that is the difference which separates us: You want the crash, and
I do not want it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: From that, one might draw the conclusion that at that
time Schacht still believed that the crash could be averted. What
reasons did he give for this view?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I think that at the time the word “crash” was too
strong for him. Schacht was thinking along the traditional lines
of former governments, but he saw that here and there a change had
come about—especially since Brüning’s time—by emergency laws and
certain dictatorial measures. But as far as I could see at the time,
and during all our subsequent conversations, uppermost in his mind
was still the idea of a Reich government which met and passed
resolutions, where the majority of ministers were bourgeois, and
where at a given moment—which might be sooner or later—one
might steer a radically changed course.
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What was his attitude towards Hitler at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It was quite clear to me that at that time he still
thought very highly of Hitler. I might almost say that at that time
Hitler was to him a man of irreproachable integrity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What time are you speaking of?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I am now speaking of the time of my first meetings
with Schacht, at the end of 1934 and the beginning of 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What was your profession at that time? Where were
you? Where did you work?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I had succeeded in leaving the Reich Ministry of
the Interior in the meantime and had been transferred to the Reich
Criminal Office, which was in the process of being formed. When
we realized that the Gestapo were extending their power, we
believed we could establish some sort of police apparatus side by
side with the Gestapo—that is, purely criminal police. My friend
Nebe had been made Chief of the Reich Criminal Department to
build up a police apparatus there which would enable us to resist
the Gestapo if need be. The Ministry of the Interior gave me the
task of organizing and sent me to this government office about to
be formed, to give advice for its establishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We now slowly approach the year 1936—the year of
the Olympic Games. Did you have a special assignment there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. At the beginning of 1936 it was decided to
make me Chief of Staff of the police at the Central Police Department
on the occasion of the Olympic Games in Berlin. That was an
entirely nonpolitical and technical affair. Count Helldorf, who was
then Commissioner of the Police, thought that because of my connections
with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of
Justice this would be useful. But I was quickly removed from this
position. Heydrich discovered it and intervened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your book contains a letter from Heydrich, which I
do not propose to read in its entirety. It is addressed to Count
Helldorf and calls his attention to the fact that, during the time of
your office at the Prussian Ministry of the Interior, you always put
every possible difficulty in the way of the Secret State Police, and
that relations with you had been extremely unpleasant. He continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I fear that his participation in the police preparations for
the Olympic Games, even in this sphere, would not promote
co-operation with the Secret State Police, and it should, therefore,
be considered whether Gisevius should not be replaced
by another suitable official. Heil Hitler. Yours, Heydrich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that the letter which affected your position?
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. That was the reason why I was also dismissed
from that job. I had to wait only a few more weeks and Himmler
became the Chief of Police in the Reich. And on the very day that
Himmler became the Reich Police Chief I was definitely removed
from any kind of police service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And where did you go?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: After my discharge from the police service I was
sent to the government in Münster, where I was assigned to the
price control office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Could you, while in the price control office in Münster,
continue your political work in any way and make the necessary
contacts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I had plenty of opportunity to make official
journeys. I made a thorough study not only of prices, but also of
the political situation, in the Rhineland and in Westphalia, and went
to Berlin nearly every week so as to keep in touch with my friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Were you in touch with Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: From that time on I met him very nearly every
week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you, from Münster, make contacts with other
persons in prominent positions to further the work you were doing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. One of the reasons why I went to Münster was
that the president of the province, Freiherr Von Luening, was a
man of the old school—clean, correct, a professional civil servant,
and politically a man who upheld law and order. He, too, ended
on the gallows after 20 July 1944. I also got into touch in Düsseldorf
with Regierungspräsident State Secretary Schmidt, and immediately
upon my arrival in Münster I did everything to get into
touch with the commanding general there, Von Kluge, who later
became Field Marshal. In this I succeeded. There, too, I tried at
once to continue my old political discussions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We shall revert to General Kluge later on. I now ask
you this: At that time when you were working in Münster, did
you perceive a change in Schacht’s attitude towards the regime,
and in his attitude towards Hitler, as distinct from what you described
to the Tribunal as existing in 1934?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. By a steady process Schacht withdrew himself
further and further from the Nazis. If I were asked to describe the
phases, I would say that in the beginning—that is to say, in 1935—he
was of the opinion that the Gestapo only was the main evil and
that Hitler was the man who was the statesman—or could at least
become the statesman—and that Göring was the conservative strong
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
man whose services one ought to use, and could use, to oppose the
terror of the Gestapo and the State by establishing orderly conditions.
I contradicted Schacht vehemently regarding his views
about the Defendant Göring. I warned him. I told him that in my
opinion Göring was the worst of all, precisely because he was
hiding under the middle class, conservative cloak. I implored him
not to effect his economic policy with Göring, since this could only
come to a bad end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht—for whom much may be said, but not that he is a good
psychologist—denied this emphatically. Only then in the course
of 1936 he began to realize more and more that Göring was not
supporting him against the Party, but that Göring supported the
radical elements against him, only then did Schacht’s attitude begin
to change gradually, and he came to regard not only Himmler but
also Göring as a great danger. For him Hitler was still the one
man with whom one could create policy, provided the majority of
the cabinet could succeed in bringing him over to the side of law
and order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Are you now talking approximately of the time when
Schacht was handing over the foreign currency control to Göring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. That was the moment when I warned him and,
as I said, he became apprehensive about Göring and realized that
Göring was not supporting him against the radical elements. That
was the time I meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: By handing over the foreign currency control to Göring
he showed a negative, a yielding attitude. But now that he was
gradually changing his views, did he not have any positive ideas
as to how to bring about a change?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. He was entirely taken up with the idea, like
many other people in Germany at that time—I might almost say
the majority of the people in Germany—the idea that everything
depended on strengthening the middle class influence in the cabinet,
and above all, and as a prerequisite, that the Reich Ministry of War,
headed by Blomberg, should be brought over to the side of the
middle class ministers. Schacht had, if you want to put it like that,
the very constructive idea that one must concentrate on the fight
for Blomberg. That was precisely where I agreed with him for it
was the same battle which I, with my friend Oster, had tried to
fight in my small department, and in a far more modest way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Had he already done anything to achieve that end at
that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: As a cue I mention the steps taken by Dreyse, the
Vice President of the Reichsbank.
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. First of all, he tried to establish close contact
with the competent expert in the Ministry of War, General Thomas,
who later on became Chief of the Army Economic Staff. Thomas
was a man who, right from the beginning, was skeptical about
National Socialism, or even opposed it. As by a miracle, he later on
emerged from the concentration camp alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht at that time began to fight for Blomberg through
Thomas. I took part in that fight because Schacht used me as an
intermediary through Oster, and I was also informed about these
connections through Herbert Göring. Moreover, I learned about
these things from many discussions with Thomas. I can testify here
that, even at that time, it was extraordinarily difficult to establish
connection between Schacht and Blomberg, and I was naïve enough
to tell Schacht repeatedly simply to telephone Blomberg and ask
him for an interview. Schacht replied that Blomberg would certainly
be evasive and that the only way was to prepare the meeting
via Oster and Thomas. This was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know how much we expected from the many discussions
Schacht had with Blomberg. I was, of course, not present as a
witness, but we discussed these conferences in great detail at the
time. I took notes and was very pleased when I found that these
recollections of mine tallied absolutely with the recollections of
Thomas, whose handwritten notes I have in my possession. Thomas
was repeatedly reprimanded by Blomberg and was told not to
bother him with these qualms on Schacht’s part. He was told that
Schacht was querulous, and that he, Thomas, should...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it necessary to go into all this detail,
Dr. Dix?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, I believe, Your Lordship, that it will be necessary.
This change from a convinced follower of Hitler to a resolute opponent
and revolutionary, even a conspirator, is of course so complicated
a psychological process that I believe that I cannot spare
the Tribunal the details of that development. I shall certainly be
economical with nonessential matters, but I should be grateful if
the witness could be given a certain amount of freedom during this
part of the testimony, as he is the only witness I have on this
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal thinks that you can give
the essence of the matter without giving it in this great detail. You
must try, at any rate, to give as little unnecessary detail as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I shall be glad to do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, Dr. Gisevius, you have heard the wish of the Tribunal
and you will no doubt bring out only the essential facts.
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Is there any other essential fact in the affair of Blomberg via
Thomas that you wish to state, or can we conclude that chapter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I shall now try to give a brief description of the
other channels which were tried. I do not know how much the
Tribunal wishes to hear about it, but I will say that Schacht tried
to approach Baron Von Fritsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Army. As, however, he was very difficult to approach, he sent his
Reichsbank vice president, Dreyse, to establish the contact. We also
made one big attempt to approach Fritsch and Blomberg through
General Von Kluge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And, briefly, what was the object of that step? What
were the generals supposed to do—I mean these generals mentioned
by you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: This step had as its object to make it clear to
Blomberg that things were taking a more and more extreme turn,
that the economy of the country had deteriorated, and that the
Gestapo terror must be stopped by all possible means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: So that at the time there were only misgivings about
the economy and the terror which reigned—not about the danger
of war, not yet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, only the fear of extremism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We now turn to 1937. You know that was the year
of Schacht’s dismissal as Reich Minister of Economy. Did Schacht
say anything to you as to why he remained in office as President
of the Reichsbank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I witnessed in detail the struggle for his release
as Reich Minister of Economy. On the one side there was his
attempt to be released from the Ministry, and I think I am right
in saying that this was not so easy. Schacht told Lammers one day
that if he did not receive the official notification of his release by
a certain date, he would consider himself dismissed and inform the
press accordingly. On that occasion scores of people implored
Schacht not to resign. Throughout those years, whenever a man
wanted to resign from his post, there was always the question
whether his successor might not steer an even more radical course.
Schacht was implored not to leave, lest radicalism should gain the
upper hand in the economic field also. I only mention here the
name of Ley, as head of the labor front. Schacht replied that he
could not bear the responsibility, but that he hoped he would be
able as President of the Reichsbank to keep one foot in, as he
expressed it. He imagined that he would be able to have a general
view of the overall economic situation and that through the Reichsbank
he would be able to conserve certain economic-political
measures. I can testify that many men, who later became members
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
of the opposition, implored Schacht to take that line and to keep
at least one foot in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Was that decision of his not influenced by his attitude
to, and his judgment concerning some of the generals particularly
Colonel General Fritsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that is quite right. One of the greatest disasters
was the fact that so many people in Germany imagined that Fritsch
was a strong man. I remember that not only high-ranking officers
but also high ministerial officials told me over and over again that
there was no need to worry: Fritsch was on the march; Fritsch was
only waiting for the right moment; Fritsch would one fine day
bring about a revolt and end the terror. General Von Kluge, for
instance, told me this as a fact—and he was a close friend of Fritsch.
And so we all lived in the completely mistaken belief—as I can
now say—that one day the great revolt would come of the Armed
Forces against the SS. But instead of this, the exact opposite
occurred, namely, the bloodless revolt of the SS, the famous Fritsch
crisis, the result of which was that not only Fritsch was relieved
of his post but that the entire Armed Forces leadership was
beheaded, politically speaking, which meant that now all our hope...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Forgive me if I interrupt you, but we shall come to
the Fritsch crisis later, which was in 1938...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I should like now to finish speaking about Schacht’s
efforts and actions in 1937 and to ask you—it is mentioned in your
book—whether some unsuccessful attempt to approach General
Von Kluge and a journey by Schacht to Münster did not play a part?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I thought that I was supposed to be brief about
that. Although Schacht made a great effort to get in touch with
Fritsch, it was not possible to arrange a conversation in Berlin. It
was secretly arranged that they should meet in Münster, as General
Von Kluge was too scared to meet Schacht publicly at the time.
There was a lot of beating about the bush, the net result was that
the two gentlemen did not meet. It was not possible to bring
together a Reich minister and a commanding general. It was all
most depressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Where were you at the time? What were you doing?
Were you still at Münster, or was there a change?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I was still in Münster at that time, but in the
middle of 1937 Schacht wanted me to return to Berlin. The greater
his disappointment, the more he was inclined to take seriously my
warnings against an increasing radicalism and an SS revolt.
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By the autumn of 1937 things in Germany had reached such a
point that everybody in the opposition group felt that evil plans
were being made. We thought at that time that there would be
another day of blood like 30 June, and we were trying to protect
ourselves. It was Schacht who got in touch with Canaris through
Oster and expressed the wish that I should be brought back to
Berlin in one way or another. At that time there was
no government office which would have given me a post. I had
no other choice but to take a long leave from the civil service,
alleging that I wanted to devote myself to economic studies.
Schacht, in agreement with Canaris and Oster, arranged for me to
be given such a post in a Bremen factory, but I was not allowed
to show myself there, and so I came to Berlin to place myself completely
at the disposal of my friends for future happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, we are now coming to January 1938
and the Fritsch crisis. I do not think that it would be helpful to
interrupt that part of the witness’ testimony. If I may, I would
suggest that Your Lordship now adjourn the session, or else we
would have to go on at least another half hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Well, we’ll adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 25 April 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEENTH DAY</span><br/> Thursday, 25 April 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Gisevius! Yesterday we got as far as the year 1938.
You had returned to Berlin to a fictitious position which Schacht
had arranged for you and you were now in continuous contact with
your political confidants, Schacht, Oster, Canaris, and Nebe. You
testified last that within your circle, at that time, you all had the
impression that a coup was imminent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, we really come to the so-called Fritsch crisis; in my opinion
the decisive, inner-political first step toward the war. Will you
please describe the entire course and the background of that crisis,
especially bearing in mind the fact that while that crisis was taking
place the march into Austria was made and always remembering, of
course, Schacht’s position and activities which are the main concern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: First, I shall describe the course of the crisis as such;
and it is correct that all my friends considered it the first decisive
step toward the war. I shall assemble the facts one by one. I consider
it advisable, in order not to confuse the picture, to leave
Schacht out for the time being, because the facts as such are
extensive enough. Furthermore, I will not indicate in the beginning
the source of our information or describe my own experiences;
rather I shall wait until I am questioned on those subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 12 January 1938 the German public was surprised by the
report that Field Marshal Von Blomberg, at that time Reich Minister
for War, had married. No details about his wife nor any photographs
were published. A few days later one single picture appeared, a
photograph of the Marshal and his new wife in front of the monkey
cage at the Leipzig Zoo. Malicious rumors about the past life of the
Marshal’s wife began to circulate in Berlin. A few days later there
appeared on the desk of the Police Commissioner in Berlin a thick
file which contained the following information: Marshal Von Blomberg’s
wife had been a previously convicted prostitute who had
been registered as a prostitute in the files of seven large German
cities; she was in the Berlin criminal files. I myself have seen the
fingerprints and the pictures. She had also been sentenced by the
Berlin courts for distributing indecent pictures. The Commissioner
of the Police in Berlin was obliged to submit this file, by official
channels, to the Chief of the Police, Himmler.
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Excuse me, please; who was the Commissioner of the
Police in Berlin at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The Commissioner of the Police in Berlin was Count
Helldorf. Count Helldorf realized that if that material were transmitted
to the Reichsführer SS it would place the Wehrmacht in a
very embarrassing position. Himmler would then have in his possession
the material he needed to ruin Blomberg’s reputation and
career, and strike a blow at the leadership of the Armed Forces.
Helldorf took this file to the closest collaborator of Marshal Blomberg,
the then Chief of the Armed Forces Department, Keitel, who
at that time had just become related to Marshal Blomberg through
the marriage of their respective children. Marshal Keitel, or Generaloberst
Keitel as he was at that time, looked through the file
carefully and demanded that Police Commissioner Helldorf should
hush up the entire scandal and suppress the file.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Perhaps you will tell the Tribunal the source of your
information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I got my information from Count Helldorf, who described
the entire affair to me, and from Nebe, Oberregierungsrat of
the police headquarters in Berlin at that time, and later Reich
Criminal Director.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel refused to let Blomberg bear any of the consequences. He
refused to inform the Chief of the General Staff Beck, or the Chief
of the Army Generaloberst Von Fritsch. He sent Count Helldorf to
Göring with the file. Helldorf submitted the entire file to Defendant
Göring. Göring asserted he knew nothing about the various sections
of the criminal records and the previous sentences of Von Blomberg’s
wife. Nevertheless in that first conversation, and in later discussions,
he admitted that he already knew the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, that Marshal Blomberg had already asked Göring several
months ago whether it was permissible to have an affair with a
woman of low birth, and shortly thereafter he had asked Göring
whether he would help him to obtain a dispensation to marry this
lady “with a past” as he put it. Later Blomberg came again and
told Göring that this lady of his choice unfortunately had another
lover and he must ask Göring to help him, Blomberg, to get rid of
that lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Excuse me. Göring told that to Helldorf and you
learned it from Helldorf?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that is what Göring said, and in the further
course of the investigation we learned of it from other sources too.
Göring then got rid of that lover by giving him foreign currency
and sending him off to South America. In spite of that, Göring did
not inform Hitler of this incident. He even went with Hitler, as a
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
witness, to the wedding of Marshal Blomberg on 12 January. I
should like to point out here...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, the Tribunal would wish to know
how you suggest that these matters, which appear to be personal,
are relevant to the charges and in what way they affect the Defendant
Schacht or the Defendant Göring or the Defendant Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I am here only to serve the interests, the rightful
interests, of the Defendant Schacht. It is necessary to present that
crisis in all its horribleness in order to conceive what an effect, what
a revolutionary effect, it had on Schacht and his circle as far as the
regime was concerned, I have already said earlier that the Fritsch
crisis was the turning point in the transformation of Schacht from a
follower and, to a certain extent, an admirer of Hitler to a deadly
enemy who had designs on his life. The Tribunal cannot understand
this revulsion if the Tribunal does not receive the same impression
as Schacht had at that time. Indeed, I in no way desire to wash
dirty linen here unnecessarily. My decision to put these questions
and to ask the witness to describe the Fritsch crisis in full detail is
only motivated by the fact that the further development of Schacht,
and of the Fritsch crisis, or let us say, the Oster-Canaris circle to
which Schacht belonged, cannot be understood if one does not realize
the monstrous circumstances of that crisis. In the face of these
facts, however disagreeable, one must decide to bring these sometimes
very personal matters to the attention of the Tribunal. Unfortunately
I cannot dispense with it in my defense. It is the alpha
and omega of my defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If the Tribunal please, it might be
helpful at this time to know our position in reference to this line of
testimony, if it is to be considered whether admissible or not now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should desire, if this incident were not brought out, to bring it
out upon cross-examination upon several aspects. One is that it
shows the background of the incident of yesterday, which I think is
important in appraising the truthfulness of testimony in this case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another thing is that it bears upon the conspiracy to seize power.
There were certain men in Germany that these conspirators had to
get rid of. Some of them they could kill safely. Some of them, as
we see from the Röhm Purge, when they went to killing they
aroused some opposition. They had to strike down by other means,
and the means they used against Fritsch and Blomberg show the
conspiracy to seize power and to get rid of the men who might stand
in the way of aggressive warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will appear, I think, that Fritsch and Blomberg were among
the reliants of the German people in allowing these Nazis to get as
far as they did, believing that here at least were two men who
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
would guard their interests; and the method by which those men
were stricken down and removed from the scene we would consider
an important part of the conspiracy story, and I would ask to go
into it on cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That might perhaps be material to the Court in deciding whether
it should proceed now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I add one more thing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Dr. Dix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal thinks, in view of what you have said and what
Mr. Justice Jackson has said, that your examination must continue
and you will no doubt try to confine it as much as you can to the
political aspects of the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Of course. But the personal matters are of such political
importance in this case that they cannot be omitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well then, Dr. Gisevius, you understand the difficulties of the
situation. We want only to give evidence, and not to bring in anything
sensational as an end in itself. However, when it is necessary
to speak on such subjects in order to explain the development to the
Tribunal, I ask you to speak quite frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I ask the Tribunal also to realize my difficulties. I
myself do not like speaking about these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must add that Göring was the only head of the Investigation
Department. That was the institution which took overall telephone
control in the Third Reich. This Investigation Department was not
satisfied, as has been described here, with merely tapping telephone
conversations and decoding messages; but it had its own intelligence
service, all the way down to its own employees, for obtaining information.
It was, therefore, also quite possible to obtain confidential
information about Marshal Von Blomberg’s wife. When Helldorf
gave the file to Göring, Göring considered himself compelled to give
that file to Hitler. Hitler had a nervous breakdown and decided to
dismiss Marshal Blomberg immediately. Hitler’s first thought, as he
told the generals later at a public meeting, was to appoint Generaloberst
Von Fritsch as Blomberg’s successor. The moment he made
his decision known, Göring and Himmler reminded him that it could
not be done as according to a file of the year 1935 Fritsch was badly
incriminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Excuse me, Doctor. What is the source of your information
regarding this conversation between Hitler and the generals
and also Göring’s statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Several generals who took part in that meeting told
me about it, and I have said already that in the course of events,
which I have yet to describe, Hitler himself made many statements.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
We also had in our possession until 20 July the original documents
of the Supreme Court-Martial which convened later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The file of 1935, which was submitted to Hitler in January 1938,
referred to the fact that in 1934 the Gestapo conceived the idea of
prosecuting, among other enemies of the state, homosexuals as
criminals. In the search for evidence the Gestapo visited the penitentiaries
and asked convicted inmates, who had blackmailed homosexuals,
for evidence and for the names of homosexuals. One of the
inmates reported a terrible story, which was really so horrible that
I will not repeat it here. It will suffice to say that this prisoner
believed the man in question had been a certain Herr Von Fritsch
or Frisch. The prisoner could not remember the correct name. The
Gestapo then turned over these files to Hitler in 1935. Hitler was
indignant about the contents. Talking to the generals, he said he
did not want to know about such a disgusting affair. Hitler ordered
the files to be burned immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in January 1938, Göring and Himmler reminded Hitler of
these files; and it was left to Heydrich’s cleverness to submit to
Hitler again these files, which had allegedly been burned in 1935
and which had been completed, in the meantime, by extensive
investigations. Hitler believed, as he said to the generals at the
time, that after having been so disappointed in Blomberg, many
nasty things could be expected from Fritsch also. The Defendant
Göring offered to bring the convict from the prison to Hitler and
the Reich Chancellery. At Karinhall, Göring had previously threatened
this convict with death if he did not abide by his statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How do you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was mentioned at the Supreme Court-Martial.
Then Fritsch was summoned to the Reich Chancellery and Hitler
told him of the accusations which had been made against him.
Fritsch, a gentleman through and through, had received a confidential
warning from Hitler’s adjutant; but it had been so vague
that Fritsch came to the Reich Chancellery extremely alarmed. He
had no idea of what Hitler was accusing him. Indignantly he denied
the crime he had allegedly committed. In the presence of Göring,
he gave Hitler his word of honor that all the accusations were false.
But Hitler went to the nearest door, opened it, and the convict
entered, raised his arm, pointed to Fritsch and said, “That is he.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritsch was speechless. He was only able to ask that a judicial
investigation should be made. Hitler demanded his immediate
resignation; and on condition that Fritsch left in silence, he agreed
to allow the matter to rest where it was. Fritsch appealed to Beck,
the Chief of the General Staff. Chief of the General Staff Beck
intervened with Hitler. A hard struggle ensued for a judicial
investigation of these terrible accusations against Fritsch. That
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
struggle lasted about a week. There were dramatic disputes in the
Reich Chancellery. At the end came the famous 4 February when
the generals, who until that day—that is to say, 10 days after the
dismissal of Blomberg and the relief of Fritsch—were completely
unaware of the fact that both their superiors were no longer in
office, were ordered to come to Berlin. Hitler personally presented
the files to the generals in such a way that they also were completely
confused and said they were satisfied that the affair should
be investigated by the courts. At the same time Hitler surprised
the generals...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You know of this only through the participants of that
meeting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: From the participants of the meeting, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time Hitler surprised the generals with the announcement
that they had a new Commander-in-Chief, Generaloberst
Von Brauchitsch. Some of the generals had, in the meantime, been
relieved of their posts; and also on the evening previous to that
announcement, a report appeared in the newspapers according to
which Hitler, under the pretense of drawing together the reins of
government, had dismissed the Foreign Minister, Von Neurath,
effected a change in the Ministry of Economics, relieved a number
of diplomats of their posts, and then, as an appendix to that report,
announced a change in the War Ministry and in the leadership of
the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a new struggle arose, which lasted several weeks, regarding
the convening of the court-martial which should decide as to the
reinstatement of Generaloberst Von Fritsch. This was for all of us
the moment when we believed we would be able to prove before a
German supreme court the methods the Gestapo used to rid themselves
of their political adversaries. This was a unique opportunity
of being able to question witnesses under oath regarding the manner
in which the entire intrigue had been contrived. Therefore we set
to work to prepare for our parts in this trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What do you mean by “we” in this case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: There was above all one man, who as an honest
lawyer and judge was himself a participator of this Supreme Court-Martial.
This was the Judge Advocate General at that time, and
later Chief Judge of the Army, Ministerial Director Dr. Sack. This
man believed that he owed it to the spirit of law to contribute in
every possible way toward exposing these matters. This he did, but
he also paid with his life after 20 July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of this investigation the judges of this Supreme
Court-Martial questioned the Gestapo witnesses. They investigated
the records of the Gestapo; they made local investigations; and, with
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
the aid of the criminologist Nebe, it was not long before they
discovered definitely that the entire affair had concerned a double;
it was not Generaloberst Von Fritsch but a retired Captain Von
Frisch who had been pensioned long before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of that investigation the judges established another
fact; they were able to prove that the Gestapo had been in the
residence of this double Von Frisch as early as 15 January and had
questioned his housekeeper. May I compare the two dates once
more. On 15 January the Gestapo had proof that Fritsch was not
guilty. On 24 January the Defendant Göring brings the convict and
witness for the prosecution into the Reich Chancellery in order to
incriminate Fritsch, the Generaloberst. We believed that here indeed
we were confronted with a plot of incredible proportions, and we
believed that now even the skeptical general must see that it was
not only in the lower ranks of the Gestapo that there was scheming
and contriving, invisible and secret, without the knowledge of any
of the ministers or of the Reich Chancellery and which would
compel any man of honor and justice to intervene. This was the
reason why we now formed into a larger group and why we saw
that we now no longer needed to collect material about the Gestapo
in secret. That, precisely, was the great difficulty we had had to
deal with. We heard a great deal; but if we had passed on that
evidence, we would in every case have exposed to the terror of the
Gestapo those men who had given us the evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we could proceed legally, and so we started our efforts to
persuade Generaloberst Von Brauchitsch to submit the necessary
evidence to the Supreme Court-Martial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Whom do you mean by “we”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At that time there was a group, among whom I must
mention Dr. Schacht, who was then extremely active and who went
to Admiral Raeder, to Brauchitsch, to Rundstedt, and to Gürtner,
and tried to explain everywhere that the great crisis had now
arisen; that we now had to act; that it was now the task of the
generals to rid us of this regime of terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I must mention one more name in that connection. In 1936
Schacht had already introduced me to Dr. Goerdeler. I had the
honor of traveling the same road with that brave man from then on
until 20 July. And now I have mentioned here for the first time, in
this room where so many terrible things are made known, the name
of a German who was a brave and fearless fighter for freedom,
justice, and decency and who, I believe, will one day be an example,
and not only to Germany, to prove that one can also do one’s duty
faithfully until death, even under the terror of the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Dr. Goerdeler, who had always been a fearless and untiring
fighter, had in those days unequaled courage. Like Dr. Schacht he
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
went from one ministry to another, from one general to the next,
and he also believed that now the hour had come when we could
achieve a united front of decent people led by the generals.
Brauchitsch did not refuse then. He did not refuse to act at Goerdeler’s
request. In fact he assured Goerdeler of his co-operation in
a revolt with almost religious fervor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as a witness I may mention that Brauchitsch also solemnly
assured me that he would now use this opportunity to fight against
the Gestapo. However, Brauchitsch made one condition, and that
condition was accepted by the generals as a whole. Brauchitsch
said, “Hitler is still such a popular man; we are afraid of the Hitler
myth. We want to give to the German people and to the world the
final proof by means of the Supreme Court-Martial and its verdict.”
Therefore Brauchitsch postponed his action until the day when the
verdict of the Supreme Court-Martial should be given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Supreme Court-Martial met. It began its session. The
session was suddenly interrupted under dramatic circumstances.
I must add that Hitler appointed the Defendant Göring as president
of that Supreme Court-Martial. And now the Supreme Court-Martial,
under the chairmanship of Göring, convened. I know from
Nebe that Göring during the preceding days had had consultations
with Himmler and Heydrich. I know that Heydrich said to Nebe,
“this Supreme Court-Martial will be the end of my career.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did Nebe tell you that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, on the same day. The Supreme Court-Martial
would be the great danger for the Gestapo. And now the Supreme
Court-Martial sat for several hours and was adjourned under
dramatic circumstances, for that was the day chosen for the German
armies to march into Austria. Even at that time we knew without
any doubt why the chairman of that court-martial was so unusually
interested in having the troops on that day receive the order to
march, not to a goal within but outside the Reich. Not until one
week later could the Supreme Court-Martial reconvene, and then
Hitler was triumphant. The generals had their first “campaign of
flowers” behind them, a plebiscite had been proclaimed, the
jubilation was great, and the confusion among the generals was still
greater. So that court-martial was dissolved. Fritsch’s innocence
was definitely established, but Brauchitsch said that as a result of
the changed psychological atmosphere created by the annexation of
Austria, he could no longer take the responsibility for a revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is roughly the story of how the War Ministry was practically
denuded of its leading men, and how the generals were thrown
into unequaled confusion. From that time on we took the steep
downward path to radicalism.
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Perhaps I may ask the Tribunal to be permitted to
read in this connection one sentence from a document which I will
submit as Exhibit Number Schacht-15. My document book is still in
the process of translation, but I hope that it will be here on the day
of the hearing of Schacht. There is only one sentence which is of
interest in this connection. It is from the biannual report of the
General Staff...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have the documents been submitted to the
Prosecution and to the Tribunal at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The documents have been discussed with the Prosecution
twice in detail, once with regard to the question of translation,
and then on the question of their admissibility as evidence;
and Mr. Dodd discussed them in open court. I am firmly convinced
that the Prosecution is thoroughly acquainted with the document.
It is only one sentence and I do not believe that the Prosecution
would object to the reading of this one sentence, since otherwise the
connection with the documentary evidence might be obscured. I will
introduce a document now and then, wherever it seems practical.
This is only one sentence from the biannual report of the General
Staff of the United States...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I do not know what this document is,
Your Honor. I should like to know because we may want to ask
some questions about it. I do not want to delay Dr. Dix, but I do
not have a copy of it and I do not know just what it is yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I just wanted to shorten the proceedings; but as I see
that difficulties may arise, and that a long discussion may be
needed, I will omit it, and will present it later with my documentary
evidence. It would not serve my purpose otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] For the additional information of the
Court, perhaps you will describe the position of the chairman in
German court-martial proceedings; that the control of the examination
is in his hands—that, as a matter of fact, the entire case is
in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Dr. Dix, I do not doubt that you could describe the
authority of such a chairman better and more clearly from the legal
point of view. I would, however, like to say the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read the minutes of that session, for it is one of those documents
which we thought we would one day submit to the public. This, too,
I hope we will find again. From the minutes it can be seen that the
Defendant Göring, as president, determined the tenor of the entire
proceedings and of the questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He questioned the witnesses for the prosecution, and he took
care that no other questions were put which might have proved
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
embarrassing. I must say, from these voluminous minutes, that
Göring knew how to cloak the true facts by the manner in which he
led the proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In my introductory words at the beginning of the
session, I called the Fritsch crisis the first decisive inner-political
step of the war; and you, Doctor, have adopted that term. After
concluding the description of the Fritsch crisis, will you give the
reason for the views you adopted, and what the effect was upon
your group in this connection, especially upon Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I must point out again that until this Fritsch crisis it
had been difficult in the ranks of the German opposition to consider
even the possibility of war. That was due to the fact that in Germany
the opposition groups were so sure of the strength of the
Army, and of the leading men, that they believed it sufficed to have
a man of honor, like Fritsch, at the head of the German Army. It
seemed inconceivable that Fritsch would tolerate a sliding into
terror or into war. Only a few persons had pointed out that it was
in the nature of every revolution some day to go beyond the frontiers
of a nation. We believed from history that this theory should
be pointed out as a danger threatening the National Socialist
revolution, and therefore we repeatedly warned those who were
convinced that they were faced with a revolution, not only with a
dictatorship, that one day those revolutionaries would resort to war
as a last recourse. As it became more evident in the course of the
Fritsch crisis that radicalism was predominant, a large circle became
aware that the danger of war could no longer be ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And did the Defendant Schacht also belong to that
circle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. During those days of the Fritsch crisis, Schacht
said, as did many others: “That means war,” and that was also said
plainly to the then Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General
Von Brauchitsch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now the question arises why Schacht had previously
financed the rearmament program, at least in the beginning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht always told me that he had financed the
rearmament program for purposes of defense. Schacht was convinced
for many years that such a large nation in the center of Europe
should at least have means of defense. I may point out that at that
time large groups of the German people were possessed of the idea
that there was a possible danger of attack from the East. You must
not forget the type of propaganda with which the German people
were inundated at that time, and that the reasons given for this
particular danger from the East were based upon Polish aspirations
concerning East Prussia.
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did Schacht also discuss with you at that time the fact
that this rearmament was serving his political purposes, as through
it he might be able to start discussions on general disarmament
again?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I beg your pardon. Unfortunately I forgot to emphasize
this point myself. Schacht was of the opinion that all means
should be used to bring about discussions on rearmament again. He
had an idea that very soon—I think he had held that opinion since
1935—the attention of opponent countries should be drawn to German
rearmament; and then Hitler, because his rearmament was now
known, would be forced to resume discussions at the disarmament
conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Was that which you have just said the subject of your
conversation with Schacht at that time, or is that your judgment now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I remember this conversation very well, because
I thought Hitler’s inclinations lay in other directions than in attending
a disarmament conference. I thought Hitler to be of an entirely
different mentality, and was somewhat surprised that Schacht considered
it possible that Hitler might harbor such thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you have the impression from your conversations
with Schacht that he was informed in detail of the type, speed, and
extent of the rearmament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I well remember how often Schacht asked me and
friends of mine whether we could not help him to get information
about the extent of rearmament by inquiring at the Reich War
Ministry. I have already described yesterday the efforts he made to
get details through Oster and Thomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Could you tell the Tribunal whether Schacht made any
attempt to limit armament expenses, and thus limit the extent and
speed of the rearmament; and, if so, when he made these efforts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: To my knowledge, he started to attempt this as early
as 1936. In the heated debates about Schacht’s resignation as
Minister of Economics in 1937, his efforts in this direction played a
very important part. I recall that practically every conversation was
concerned with that point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, it is said—and quite understandably also by the
Prosecution—that the reasons Schacht gave, even in official reports
and so on, for the necessity of these limitations were primarily of a
financial-technical nature, that is to say, he spoke as an anxious
economic leader and an anxious president of the Reichsbank and not
as an anxious patriot afraid that his country might be plunged
into war.
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know of any discussions with Schacht, of which you can
remember anything, concerning the foregoing which might be
useful to the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In all these preliminary discussions there were
dozens of drafts of the communications Schacht wrote. They were
discussed in friendly circles. To mention but one example, Schacht
repeatedly discussed these drafts also with Goerdeler. It was always
one question that was concerned: What could one say, so that such
a letter should not be considered a provocation but would serve
rather to draw the other non-Party ministers, and particularly the
War Minister Blomberg, to Schacht’s side? That was just the difficulty,
for how could such ministers as Blomberg, Neurath, or
Schwerin-Krosigk, who were much more loyal to Hitler, be persuaded
to join Schacht rather than to say that Schacht had once
again provoked Hitler and Göring with his notoriously sharp tongue.
All these letters can only be understood by their tactical reasons
which, as I have said, had been discussed in detail with the leading
men of the opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, after the Fritsch crisis, how did the political
conspiracy between you and your friends and Schacht take form?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I want to deal with that word “conspiracy.” While
up to that moment our activity could only be called more or less
oppositional, now a conspiracy did indeed begin; and there appeared
in the foreground a man who was later to play an important part
as head of that conspiracy. The Chief of the General Staff at that
time, Generaloberst Beck, believed that the time had come for a
German general to give the alarm both inside and outside the
country. I believe it is important for the Tribunal to know also the
ultimate reason which prompted Beck to take that step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the General Staff was present when Hitler, in May
1938, made a speech to the generals at Jüterbog. That speech was
intended to reinstate Fritsch. A few words were said about Fritsch,
but more was said—and for the first time quite openly before a
large group of German generals—about Hitler’s intention to engulf
Czechoslovakia in a war. Beck heard that speech; and he was indignant
that he, as Chief of the General Staff, should hear of such
an intention for the first time in such an assembly without having
been informed or consulted previously. During that same meeting,
Beck sent a letter to Brauchitsch asking him for an immediate
interview. Brauchitsch refused and deliberately kept Beck waiting
for several weeks. Beck became impatient and wrote a comprehensive
memorandum in which as Chief of the General Staff he
protested against the fact that the German people were being
drawn into war. At the end of that memorandum Beck announced
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
his resignation, and here I believe is the opportunity to say a word
about this Chief of the General Staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One moment, Doctor. Will you tell us the source of
your knowledge of what Beck thought, and the negotiations between
Beck and Brauchitsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Beck confided in me, and during the latter years I
worked in very close collaboration with him, and I was by his side
until the last hour of his life on 20 July. I can testify here—and
it is important for the Tribunal to know this—that Beck struggled
again and again with the problem as to what a chief of the General
Staff should do when he realized that events were driving toward
a war. Therefore I owe to his memory, and to my oath here, not to
conceal the fact that Beck took the consequences of being the only
German general to relinquish his post voluntarily, in order to show
that there is a limit beyond which even generals in leading positions
may not go; but at the sacrifice of their position and their life,
must resign and accept no further orders. Beck was of the opinion
that the General Staff was not only an organization of war technicians;
he saw in the German General Staff the conscience of the
German Army, and he trained his staff accordingly. He suffered
immensely during the later years of his life because men whom he
had trained in that spirit did not follow the dictates of their
conscience. I owe it to this man to say that he was a man of inflexible
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, I think we might get on to what
Beck actually did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, Your Honor, but...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps it would be a convenient time to
break off. What I mean is, the witness said that Beck protested in
a memorandum and offered to resign, and that was some minutes
ago, and since then he was talking and had not told us what
Beck actually did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will not sit in open session on
Saturday morning, but will be sitting in closed session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] You were saying that Generaloberst
Beck carried out his decision to tender his resignation
after the speech at Jüterbog. What did he do then?
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Hitler and Brauchitsch urgently pressed him to
remain in office, but Beck refused and insisted upon resigning.
Thereupon Hitler and Brauchitsch urged Beck at least not to make
his resignation public, and they asked him if he would not formally
defer his resignation for a few months. Beck, who had not yet gone
the way of high treason, thought that he should comply with this
request. Later he most deeply regretted this loyal attitude. The
fact is that as early as the end of May or the beginning of June
his successor, General Halder, took over the office of Chief of
General Staff; and from that moment Beck was actually no longer
in charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I ask you once more, from what observations,
and conversations with whom, do you base the knowledge of these
facts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: From constant discussions I had with Beck, Oster,
Goerdeler, Schacht, and an entire group of people at that time;
later, the question why Beck did not make his retirement public
depressed him to such an extent that it was a continual subject of
discussions between him and me up to the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That was Beck’s resignation; but then the problem of
the possible resignation of Schacht was probably also brought up in
deliberations. To your knowledge, and from your observation, was
the question of the necessity or the opportuneness of Schacht’s
resignation discussed between Schacht and Beck?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, it was discussed in great detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Beck’s opinion that his resignation alone might not be
sufficiently effective. He approached Schacht therefore and asked
him whether he would not join him, Beck, and resign also. This
subject was discussed in great detail, on the one hand between
Beck and Schacht personally, and on the other between Oster and
myself, who were the two intermediaries. During these conferences,
I must confess that I, too, was of the opinion that Schacht should
resign under all circumstances; and I also advised him to that effect.
It was Oster’s opinion, however, that Schacht must definitely remain
in office and he asked him to do so; in order to influence the
generals Schacht was needed as an official with a ministerial title.
In retrospect I must say here that my advice to Schacht was wrong.
The events which I have yet to describe have proved how important
it was to Oster and others that Schacht should remain in office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That, of course, was a serious question for Schacht’s
own conscience. You have informed the Tribunal of your opinions
and of Oster’s opinions. Did Schacht discuss his scruples with you,
and the pros and cons of his deliberations in making his final
decision?
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I don’t object to the defendants
trying their case in their own way, but I do think we are passing
beyond the limits of profitable inquiry here. Schacht is present; he
is the man who can tell us about his conscience, and I know of no
way that another witness can do so, and I think it is not a question
to which the answer would have competent value, and I object
respectfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, I think you had better tell us what
Schacht did—not tell us—but get from the witness what Schacht did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: If I may, I should like to make a brief remark. It is
true, of course, as Mr. Justice Jackson said, that Schacht knows his
own reasons best and can tell them to the Tribunal. On a question
as difficult as this, however, the justification of which is even subject
to argument—the Prosecution apparently is inclined to consider
the train of thought which led to Schacht’s decision to be unacceptable—it
appears to me, at least on the basis of our rules for
evidence, that it is relevant for the Tribunal to hear from an eye-and-ear
witness what the considerations were and whether they
really were such at the time, or whether Schacht, now in the
defendants’ dock, is <span class='it'>ex post facto</span>, devising some explanation, as
every defendant is more or less suspected of doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that the witness can tell
us what Schacht said and what Schacht did, but not what Schacht
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Certainly. Your Lordship, I only want him to tell us
what Schacht said to the witness at that time about his opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think we need any further discussion
about it. The witness has heard what I have said and you can ask
him what Schacht said, and what Schacht did; but not what Schacht
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well then, what did Schacht say to you regarding
the reasons for his resignation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht told me at the time that after all we had
experienced the generals could not be relied upon ever really to
revolt. For that reason, as a politician, he considered it his duty to
think of some possibility other than a revolt for bringing about a
change in conditions in Germany. For that reason he evolved a
plan which he explained to me at the time. Schacht said to me,
“I have got Hitler by the throat.” He meant by that, as he explained
to me in great detail, that now the day was approaching
where the debts which had been incurred by the Reich Minister
of Finance, and thus by the Reich Cabinet, would have to be repaid
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
to the Reichsbank. Schacht doubted whether the Minister of Finance,
Schwerin-Krosigk, would be prepared without further ado to carry
out the moral and legal obligation of repaying the credits which
had been extended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht thought that that was the moment in which he should
come out with his resignation, with a joint step by the Reichsbank
Directorate; and he hoped that, given that situation, the other
ministers of the Reich would join him, the majority of whom were
still democratic at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is what he meant when he said to me, “I have still one
more arrow I can shoot, and that is the moment when not even a
Neurath, a Gürtner, a Seldte can refuse to follow me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I answered Schacht at that time that I doubted whether there
would ever be such a meeting of the Cabinet. In my opinion, the
steps which would be taken to dispose of him would be much more
brutal. Schacht did not believe me, and above all he told me he
would be certain of achieving one thing; these matters would have
to be discussed in the Cabinet, and then he would cause a situation
in Germany as alarming as the one which existed in February 1938
at the time of the Fritsch crisis. He therefore expected a radical
reformation of the cabinet which would provide the proper psychological
atmosphere for the generals to intervene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You said at the beginning that Schacht had said or
hinted that he could not absolutely rely on the generals to bring
about a revolt. Which generals was he referring to, and what did
he mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht meant at the time the first revolutionary
situation which had arisen in Germany, during the months of May
to September 1938, when we drifted into the Czechoslovakia war
crisis. Beck had assured us at the time of his resignation—by us I
mean Goerdeler, Schacht and other politicians—that he would leave
to us a successor who was more energetic than himself, and who
was firmly determined to precipitate a revolt if Hitler should decide
upon war. That man whom Beck trusted, and to whom he introduced
us, was General Halder. As a matter of fact, on taking office,
General Halder immediately took steps to start discussions on the
subject with Schacht, Goerdeler, Oster, and our entire group. A
few days after he took over his office he sent for Oster and informed
him that he considered that things were drifting toward
war, and that he would then undertake an overthrow of the Government.
He asked Oster what he, for his part, intended to do to bring
civilians into the plot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Who were the civilians in question, apart from
Goerdeler and Schacht?
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Halder put that question to Oster, and under the
circumstances at that time, when we were still a very small circle,
Oster replied that to the best of his knowledge there were only two
civilians with whom Halder could have preliminary political conversations;
one was Goerdeler, the other, Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Halder refused to speak personally to a man as suspect as
Goerdeler. He gave as his reason the fact that it was too dangerous
for him to receive now a man whom he did not yet know, whereas
he could find some official reason for having a conference with
Schacht. Halder asked Oster to act as intermediary for such a
conference with Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oster approached Schacht through me. Schacht was willing. A
meeting was to be arranged at a third person’s place. I warned
Schacht and said to him, “Have Halder come to your house, so that
you are quite sure of the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Halder then visited Schacht personally at the end of July 1938
at his residence; and he informed him that matters had reached a
stage where war was imminent and that he, Halder, would then
bring about a revolt, and he asked Schacht whether he was prepared
to aid him politically in a leading position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is what Schacht told me at the time, and Halder told it to
Oster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And Oster told it to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, as I continually acted as an intermediary in
these discussions. Schacht replied, as he assured me directly after
Halder’s visit, that he was prepared to do anything if the generals
were to decide to remove Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following morning, Halder sent for Oster. He told him of
this conversation, and he asked Oster whether police preparations
had now been made for this revolt. Oster suggested that Halder
should talk to me personally about these matters. I had a long talk
in the darkness with Halder about this revolt. I believe that it is
important for me to state here what Halder told me of his intentions
at that time. First Halder assured me that, in contrast to
many other generals, he had no doubt that Hitler wanted war.
Halder described Hitler to me as being bloodthirsty and referred
to the blood bath of 30 June. However, Halder told me that it was,
unfortunately, terribly difficult to explain Hitler’s real intentions
to the generals, particularly to the junior officers corps, because
the saying which was influencing the officers corps was ostensibly
that it was all just a colossal bluff, that the Army could be absolutely
certain that Hitler did not want to start a war, but rather
that he was merely preparing a diplomatic maneuver of blackmail
on a large scale.
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>For that reason, Halder believed that it was absolutely necessary
to prove, even to the last captain, that Hitler was not bluffing at
all but had actually given the order for war. Halder therefore
decided at the time that for the sake of informing the German
nation and the officers he would even risk the outbreak of war.
But even then Halder feared the Hitler myth; and he therefore
suggested to me that the day after the outbreak of war Hitler
should be killed by means of a bomb; and the German people
should be made to believe, as far as possible, that Hitler had been
killed by an enemy bombing attack on the Führer’s train. I replied
to Halder at the time that perhaps I was still too young, but I could
not understand why he did not want to tell the German people, at
least afterwards, what the generals had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then for a few weeks there was no news from Halder. The press
campaign against Czechoslovakia assumed an ever more threatening
character and we felt that now it would be only a few days, or
perhaps weeks, before war would break out. At that very moment
Schacht decided to visit Halder again and to remind him of his
promise. I thought it best that a witness should be present during
that conversation and therefore I accompanied Schacht. It did not
appear to me that Halder was any too pleased at the presence of a
witness. Halder once again declared his firm intention of effecting
a revolt; but again he wished to wait until the German nation had
received proof of Hitler’s warlike intentions by means of a definite
order for war. Schacht pointed out to Halder the tremendous
danger of such an experiment. He made it clear to Halder that a
war could not be started simply to destroy the Hitler legend in the
eyes of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a detailed and very excited conversation Halder then declared
that he was prepared to start the revolt, not after the official outbreak
of the war, but at the very moment that Hitler gave the
army the final order to march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We asked Halder whether he would then still be able to control
the situation or whether Hitler might not surprise him with some
lightning stroke. Halder replied literally, “No, he cannot deceive
me. I have designed my General Staff plans in such a way that
I am bound to know it 48 hours in advance.” I think that is important,
because during the subsequent course of events the period
of time between the order to march and the actual march itself
was considerably shortened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Halder assured us that besides the preparations in Berlin he had
an armored division ready in Thuringia under the command of
General Von Höppner, which might possibly have to halt the Leibstandarte,
which was in Munich, on the march to Berlin.
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Although Halder had told us all this, Schacht and I had a somewhat
bitter aftertaste of that conference. Halder had told Schacht
that he, Schacht, seemed to be urging him to effect this revolt
prematurely; and Schacht and I were of the opinion that Halder
might abandon us at the last moment. We informed Oster immediately
of the bad impression we had had, and we told Oster that
something absolutely must be done to win over another general in
case Halder should not act at the last minute. Oster agreed and these
are the preliminary events which led to the later General Field
Marshal Von Witzleben first coming into our circle of conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Who won Von Witzleben over?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Who did?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht won Witzleben over. Oster visited Witzleben
and told him everything that had happened. Thereupon Witzleben
sent for me, and I told him that in my opinion the police situation
was such that he, as commanding general of the Berlin Army Corps,
could confidently risk a revolt. Witzleben asked me the question
which every general put to us at that time: Whether a diplomatic
incident in the East would really lead to war or whether it was not
true, as Hitler and Ribbentrop had repeatedly told the generals in
confidence, that there was a tacit agreement with the Western
Powers giving Germany a free hand in the East. Witzleben said
that if such an agreement really existed, then, of course, he could
not revolt. I told Witzleben that Schacht with his excellent knowledge
of the Anglo-Saxon mentality could no doubt give him comprehensive
information about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A meeting between Schacht and Witzleben was arranged. Witzleben
brought with him his divisional general, Von Brockdorff, who
was to carry out the revolt in detail. Witzleben, Brockdorff, and I
drove together to Schacht’s country house for a conference which
lasted for hours. The final result was that Witzleben was convinced
by Schacht that the Western Powers would under no circumstances
allow Germany to move into the Eastern territories and that now
Hitler’s policy of surprise had come to an end. Witzleben decided
that he, on his part and independently of Halder, would make all
preparations which would be necessary if he should have to act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He issued me false papers and gave me a position at his district
headquarters so that there, under his personal protection, I could
make all the necessary police and political preparations. He delegated
General Von Brockdorff, and he and I visited all the points
in Berlin which Brockdorff was to occupy with his Potsdam Division.
Frau Strünck was at the wheel and traveling ostensibly as tourists
we settled exactly what had to be done.
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is the witness Strünck. Please excuse me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe I owe you a brief explanation as to why
Witzleben’s co-operation was absolutely necessary. It was not so
easy to find a general who had the actual authority to order his
troops to march. For instance, there were some generals in the
provinces who could not give their troops the order to march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, is it necessary to go into the matter
in such detail as to why General Witzleben should be brought in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The reasons why Witzleben was needed are perhaps
not essential for our case. We can therefore drop this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you please tell me, Dr. Gisevius, whether Schacht was kept
constantly informed of these military and police preparations which
you have described?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht was kept informed about all these matters.
We met in the evening in the residence of Von Witzleben and I
showed everything that I had worked out in writing during the day.
It was then discussed in full detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Apart from these military and police measures, which
you have mentioned, were there any political measures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, of course. We had to decide carefully what the
German nation was to be told in such a case from the point of
view of internal politics, just as there were certain preparations
which had to be made regarding the external.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What do you mean by external—foreign politics?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, of course, foreign politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Why of course? Was the Foreign Office included or
what is meant by foreign politics in this case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It is very difficult to give an explanation, because
the co-operation with foreign countries during the time of war, or
immediately before a war, is a matter which is very difficult to
discuss as we are touching upon a very controversial subject. If I
am to talk about it, then it is at least as important for me to state
the reasons which led these people to carry on such discussions
with foreign countries, as it is to give times and dates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I am sure that the Tribunal will permit you to do
so. I think that the Tribunal will permit that the motives...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think the Tribunal thinks you are going
into too great detail over these matters. If the Tribunal is prepared
to accept this witness’ evidence as true, it shows that Schacht was
negotiating with him and General Witzleben at this time with a
view to prevent the war. I say, if the Tribunal accepts it; and that
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
seems to be a matter you will not prove with the details of these
negotiations, which seem to me not very important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, but in my opinion the gravity and intensity of
the activities of these conspirators should be substantiated in detail.
In my opinion it is not sufficient that these plans...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But you have touched upon them since
10 o’clock this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, I am now proceeding in connection
with Schacht’s point of view, as to whether a survey, a political
survey of Schacht’s part...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am told that you said last night that you
would be half an hour longer. Do you remember saying that?
Perhaps it was a mistranslation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Oh no, that is quite a misunderstanding. I said that if
I were to touch upon the Fritsch crisis and complete it, it would
take another half hour—that is, the Fritsch crisis alone. Gentlemen
of the Tribunal, the position is this: We are now hearing the story
of the political opposition, in which Schacht played a leading role.
If the Defendant Göring and others had time for days to describe
the entire course of events from their point of view, I think that
justice demands that those men, represented in this courtroom by
the Defendant Schacht, who fought against that system under most
dreadful conditions of terror, should also be permitted to tell in
detail the story of their opposition movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would, therefore, ask the Tribunal—and I am not in favor
of the superfluous—to give me permission to allow the witness to
make a few more remarks on the measures taken by the group of
conspirators, Beck, Schacht, Canaris, and others, which he has
already touched upon. I beg the Tribunal to realize that I consider
it of the greatest importance; and I assume, Your Lordship, that
if it is not done now, the Prosecution will take the matter up during
cross-examination. Moreover, I believe that as it is now being told
in sequence, it will take less time than if we were to wait for the
cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not propose to tell you
how you are to prove your case, but hopes that you will deal with
it as shortly as possible and without unnecessary details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Please be sure of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well then, Witness; you had mentioned foreign political measures,
and you were about to talk of the motives which caused some
of you to enter into relations with foreign countries for the support
of your opposition movement. Will you please continue with that?
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should like simply to confine myself to the statement
that from that time on there were very detailed and weighty
discussions with foreign countries in order to try everything possible
to prevent the outbreak of war or at least to shorten it or
keep it from spreading. However, as long as I am not in a position
to speak of the motives of such a delicate matter—in connection
with which people like us would be accused of high treason, in
Germany, at least—as long as that is the case, I shall not say more
than the fact that these conversations took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I did not understand that the Tribunal would prevent
you from explaining your motives. You may state them therefore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I owe it to my conscience and above all to those
who participated and are now dead, to state here that those matters
which I have described weighed very heavily upon their consciences.
We knew that we would be accused of conspiring with
foreign countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal, of course, knows that these
matters were not conducted without danger; but we are not really
here for the purpose of considering people who have, unfortunately,
lost their lives. We are considering the case of the Defendant
Schacht at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I think the intention of the witness has been misunderstood.
He does not wish to speak about those men who lost their
lives, and he does not want to speak of the dangers; he wishes
rather to speak of the conflicts of conscience suffered by those who
planned and undertook those steps. I think that that privilege
should be granted the witness if he is to speak of this very delicate
matter here in public. I would, therefore, beg you to allow it;
otherwise the witness will confine himself to general indications
which will not be sufficient for my defense, and I assume that the
Prosecution will ask about these things in the cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you try and get him to come to the
point? We, of course, can’t tell what he wants to talk about. We can
only tell about what he does talk about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well, then, you will describe briefly the considerations
which swayed those who entered into those foreign relations, and
also describe the character of those relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Mr. President, it was not merely a question of
conscience. I was concerned with the fact that there are relatives
still alive today who might become the subject of unjust accusations;
and that is why I had to say, with reference to those conferences
abroad which I shall describe, that even our intimate circle
of friends did not agree in all respects as to what measures were to
be permitted. One wanted to go further, while another held back.
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
I owe it to the memory of the dead Admiral Canaris, for instance,
to rectify many erroneous press announcements and state that he
refused to conspire with foreign countries. I must guard against
the possibility that anything I say now might be applied to men
whom I have mentioned earlier. That is why I wanted to make this
statement, and at the same time I wanted to say that our friends
who did these things rejected the accusation of high treason,
because we felt that we were morally obliged to take these steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well then, what happened?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The following happened: Immediately after Hitler
announced his intention to invade Czechoslovakia, friends tried to
keep the British Government informed, from the first intention to
the final decision. The chain of attempts began with the journey
of Goerdeler in the spring of 1938 to London, where he gave information
concerning the existence of an opposition group which
was resolved to go to any lengths. In the name of this group the
British Government was continuously informed of what was happening
and that it was absolutely necessary to make it clear, to the
German people and to the generals, that every step across the Czech
border would constitute for the Western Powers a reason for war.
When the crisis neared its climax and when our preparations for
a revolt had been completed to the last detail, we took a step
unusual in form and substance. We informed the British Government
that the pending diplomatic negotiations would not, as Hitler
asserted, deal with the question of the Sudeten countries but that
Hitler’s intention was to invade the whole of Czechoslovakia and
that, if the British Government on its side were to remain firm,
we could give the assurance that there would be no war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were, at the time, our attempts to obtain a certain amount
of assistance from abroad in our fight for the psychological preparation
of a revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We now come to September of 1938 and the crisis
which led to the Munich Conference. What were the activities of
your group of conspirators at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The more the crisis moved towards the Munich
conference, the more we tried to convince Halder that he should
start the revolt at once. As Halder was somewhat uncertain, Witzleben
prepared everything in detail. I shall now describe only the
last two dramatic days. On 27 September it was clear that Hitler
wanted to go to the utmost extremity. In order to make the German
people war-minded he ordered a parade of the Berlin army through
Berlin. Witzleben had to execute the order. The parade had entirely
the opposite effect. The population, which assumed that the troops
were marching to war, showed their open displeasure. The troops,
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
instead of jubilation, saw clenched fists; and Hitler, who was
watching the parade from the window of the Reich Chancellery, had
a fit of rage. He stepped back from the window and said, “With such
people I cannot wage war.” Witzleben came home indignant and
said that he would have liked to have had the guns unlimbered in
front of the Reich Chancellery. On the next morning...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One moment, Witzleben told you that he would have
liked to have had the guns unlimbered in front of the Chancellery?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And what is the source of your knowledge regarding
Hitler’s remark when he stepped back from the balcony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Several people from the Reich Chancellery told
us that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well then, go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The following morning—that was the 28th—we
believed that the opportunity had now come to carry out the revolt.
That morning we also learned that Hitler had rejected the final offer
from the British Prime Minister, Chamberlain, and had sent the
intermediary, Wilson, back with a refusal. Witzleben got that letter
and took it to Halder. He believed that proof of Hitler’s desire for
war had now been produced, and Halder agreed. Halder went to
see Brauchitsch while Witzleben waited in Halder’s room. After a
few moments Halder came back and said that Brauchitsch now had
also realized that the moment for action had arrived and that he merely
wanted to go over to the Reich Chancellery to make quite sure that
Witzleben and Halder’s account was correct. Brauchitsch went to
the Reich Chancellery after Witzleben had told him over the telephone
that everything was prepared; and it was that noon hour of
28 September when suddenly, and contrary to expectations,
Mussolini’s intervention in the Reich Chancellery took place, and
Hitler, impressed by Mussolini’s step, agreed to go to Munich; so
that actually at the last moment the revolt was eliminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You mean through Munich, don’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And now the Munich conference was over. How did
matters stand in your group of conspirators?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We were extremely depressed. We were convinced
that now Hitler would soon go to the utmost lengths. We did not
doubt that Munich was the signal for a world war. Some of our
friends wondered if we should emigrate, and that was discussed
with Goerdeler and Schacht. Goerdeler, with this idea in mind,
wrote a letter to a political friend in America and asked particularly
whether the opposition people should now emigrate. Goerdeler said,
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Otherwise to be able to continue our political work at all in Germany
in the future there is only one other possibility, and that is to
employ the methods of Talleyrand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We decided to persevere, and then events followed in quick
succession from the Jewish pogroms to the conquest of Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: But before we come to Prague, Witness, you mentioned
the Jewish pogroms; and obviously you mean November 1938. Do
you know or can you recollect what Schacht’s reaction was to those
events?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Schacht was indignant about the Jewish pogroms, and
he said so in a public speech before the personnel of the Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I shall submit that speech later as documentary evidence.
And then how did things go on from there? We have come
to the end of 1938. Were there new political events on the horizon
which had a stimulating effect on your group of conspirators?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: First of all, there was Schacht’s sudden dismissal
from the Reichsbank Directorate. Schacht’s desire for a consultation
of the Cabinet on this matter did not materialize and our hopes of
bringing about a cabinet crisis were vain. Thus our opposition
group had no connecting point and we had to wait and see what
would happen after the conquest of Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One moment; you mentioned Schacht’s dismissal from
his position as President of the Reichsbank. Can you tell us anything
about this, about the circumstances leading to it and the effect it
had on Schacht, and so on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I saw how the various letters and memoranda of the
Reichsbank Directorate were drafted, and how they were progressively
toned down, and how Schacht was then dismissed. A few
minutes after the letter of dismissal arrived from Hitler, Schacht
read it to me; and he was indignant at the contents. He repeated to
me the passage in which Hitler praised him for his participation in
the German rearmament program; and Schacht said, “And now he
wants me to undertake to go on working with him openly, and
uphold his war policy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: But then Schacht remained as a Minister without
Portfolio. Was the problem as to whether he should do so or
whether he could act differently ever discussed between you and
Schacht at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, but as far as I know it was the same type of
discussion which took place whenever he was to resign. He talked
to Lammers, and I assume that Lammers gave him the customary
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In other words, he thought he had to remain, that he
was forced to remain?
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, you have made several attempts to speak about
Prague, but I interrupted you. Will you please describe the effects
upon your group of conspirators, as far as Schacht was concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Since December our group had definite proof that
Hitler would attack Prague in March. This new action was cynically
called the “March whirlwind.” As it was quite openly discussed in
Berlin circles, we hoped that news of this action would also reach
the British and French Embassies. We were firmly convinced that
this time results would not be achieved by surprise; but Halder had
already adopted a different view. He thought that Hitler had been
given free passage to Prague by the Western Powers. He refused to
have preliminary conferences and wanted to wait and see whether
this Prague action could be achieved without a fight. And that is
what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In which direction? You have already spoken about the
steps with the British and French Embassies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, there were no steps taken with regard to the
British and French Embassies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Do you want to say anything further about it? Have
you anything to add?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I have said that we did not take any steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, then, Prague is over; and I believe that you and
Schacht went to Switzerland together on behalf of your group. Is
that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Not only together with Schacht but also with Goerdeler.
We were of the opinion that Schacht in Germany—excuse
me—that Prague would have incredible psychological effects in
Germany. As far as foreign countries were concerned, Prague was
the signal that no peace and no treaty could be kept with Hitler.
Inside Germany unfortunately we were forced to see that the generals
and the people were now convinced that this Hitler could do
whatever he wished; nobody would stop him; he was protected by
Providence. This alarmed us. On one side we saw that the Western
Powers would no longer put up with these things; and on the other
side we saw that within Germany the illusion was growing that the
Western Powers would not go to war. We could see that a war
could be prevented only if the Western Powers would tell not only
the Foreign Minister, not only Hitler, but by every means of propaganda
tell the German nation that any further step towards the
East would mean war. It appeared to us that the only possibility
was to warn the generals and to get them to revolt, and that was the
subject of the talks which Schacht, Goerdeler, and I conducted in
Switzerland, immediately after Prague.
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: With whom?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We met a man who had excellent connections with
the British and French Governments. This man made very exact
reports at least to the French Government. I can testify to this
because later after Paris was conquered, I was able to find a copy
of his report among Daladier’s secret papers. We told this man very
clearly that in autumn at the latest, the fight for Danzig would
start. We told him that, as good Germans, we were without doubt
of the opinion that Danzig was a German city and that some day
that point would have to be peacefully discussed; but we also
warned him against having conferences now regarding Danzig alone
because Hitler did not want only Danzig but the whole of Poland,
not the whole of Poland but the Ukraine, and that that was the
reason why the propaganda of foreign countries should make it
abundantly clear to Germany that the limit had now been reached
and that the Western Powers would intervene. We said that only
then would a revolt be possible for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And did this man who had your confidence make a
report in the way you stipulated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, he did; and I must say that very soon public
statements on the part of the British, either on the radio or in the
press or in the House of Commons, began to remove these doubts
among the German generals and the German people. From that
time on everything which could be done was done by the British to
alarm the German generals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did not Schacht meet his friend Montagu Norman in
Switzerland at that time and talk with him in the same vein? Do
you know? Were you there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. We thought that the opportunity for Schacht to
talk to a close friend of the British Prime Minister, Chamberlain,
should not be allowed to pass; and Schacht had very detailed discussions
with Montagu Norman, so as to describe to him the psychological
atmosphere in Germany after Prague and to persuade him
that the British Government should now undertake the necessary
clarifications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Was not your slogan in reports to foreign countries at
the time: “You must play off the Nazis against Germans”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, it was the tenor of all our discussions. We
wanted it made clear to the German people that the Western Powers
were not against Germany, but only against this Nazi policy of
surprise and against the Nazi methods of terror, within the country
as well as without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And now, having come back from Switzerland, what
happened next, particularly with reference to Schacht?
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We saw that things in Germany were rapidly drifting
toward the August crisis and that the generals could not be dissuaded
from the view that Hitler was only bluffing and that there
would be another Munich or another Prague. And now began all
those desperate efforts which we made in order to influence the
leading generals, and particularly Keitel, to prevent the decisive
order being given to march against Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Let us come back to Schacht’s return from the Swiss
journey in spring of 1939. You know that Schacht left Germany then
and made a journey to India?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: He went to India and hoped to stay there as long as
possible in order to go to China. But on the way Hitler’s order
prohibiting him from setting foot on Chinese soil reached him, and
he had to return. As far as I remember, he came back a few days
before the outbreak of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You said China; did Schacht have sympathies with
Chiang-Kai-Chek in spite of the pact with Japan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. He sympathized greatly with the Chinese
Government, as did our entire circle. We all had quite a number
of good and dear Chinese friends with whom we attempted to keep
in touch in spite of the Japanese pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: About when did Schacht come back from India?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I think it was the beginning of August; but I
cannot...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now matters were rapidly heading toward war. Did
Schacht, before the outbreak of war, take any steps to prevent its
outbreak?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: He took a great number of steps, but they cannot be
described individually as that would create the impression that
Schacht alone was taking these steps. Actually the situation was
such that a large group of people were now in the struggle, and
each one took those steps which were most suited to him, and each
one informed the group of what he had done and what would be
advisable for another to do. For that reason I am afraid that it
would present a completely erroneous picture if I were to describe
individually, and only with respect to Schacht, all those desperate
efforts made from August 1939 until the attack on Holland and
Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Tribunal has taken cognizance of the fact that
Schacht was not acting alone; but here we are dealing with Schacht’s
case, and I should like to ask you, therefore, to confine yourself to
the description of Schacht’s efforts.
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In that case I must state first that Schacht knew of
all these other matters and was in a certain sense also an accomplice.
Of Schacht himself I can only say at this particular moment
that he was co-author of the Thomas memorandum addressed to
General Keitel, or the two memoranda, in which Schacht, together
with our group, pointed out the dangers of war to Keitel. Further,
I can say that, through Thomas and Canaris, Schacht took steps to
intervene with Brauchitsch and Halder. But I would like to
emphasize expressly that all the steps taken by Beck and Goerdeler
were taken with the full knowledge of Schacht and also with his
participation. This was a very important undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: A collective action? Does not Schacht’s attempt at the
very last moment, at the end of August, to make representations to
Brauchitsch through Canaris at headquarters play a part in this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. After General Thomas had failed with both his
memoranda and after he had failed to persuade Keitel to receive
Goerdeler or Schacht, Schacht tried to approach Brauchitsch or Halder.
For that purpose Thomas paid frequent visits to General
Halder, and it was typical that during those critical days he could
not get past the anteroom of General Halder’s office, past General
Von Stülpnagel. Halder was not “at home,” and just said that he
did not want to see Schacht. Thereupon we took a further step on
that dramatic 25 August, the day on which Hitler had already once
given the order to march. As soon as the news reached us that
Hitler had given Halder the order to march, Schacht and I first got
into touch with Thomas; and then, together with Thomas, we went
to Admiral Canaris so that both Thomas and Canaris should
accompany Schacht when he went unannounced to the headquarters
in Zossen in order to confront Brauchitsch and Halder with his
presence. Schacht intended to point out to Brauchitsch and Halder
that, in accordance with the existing constitution, the Reich Cabinet
must be consulted before waging war. Brauchitsch and Halder
would be guilty of a breach of oath if, without the knowledge of the
competent political authorities, they obeyed an order for war. That
was roughly what Schacht intended to say to explain his step. When
Thomas and Schacht arrived at Bendlerstrasse, Thomas went to
Canaris. It was about 6 o’clock or...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The OKW is situated in Bendlerstrasse. The Tribunal
should know that Bendlerstrasse meant the OKW or the OKH.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: When we arrived at the OKW and were waiting at a
corner of the street, Canaris sent Oster to us. That was the moment
when Hitler between 6 and 7 o’clock suddenly ordered Halder to
withdraw his order to march. The Tribunal will no doubt remember
that Hitler, influenced by the renewed intervention of Mussolini,
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
suddenly withdrew the order to march which had already been
given. Unfortunately, Canaris and Thomas and all our friends were
now under the impression that this withdrawal of an order to march
was an incredible loss of prestige for Hitler. Oster thought that
never before in the history of warfare had a supreme commander
withdrawn such a decisive order in the throes of a nervous breakdown.
And Canaris said to me, “Now the peace of Europe is saved
for 50 years, because Hitler has now lost the respect of the generals.”
And, unfortunately, in the face of this psychological change, we all
felt that we could look forward to the following days in a quiet
frame of mind. So, when 3 days later, Hitler nevertheless gave the
decisive order to march, it came as a complete surprise for our
group as well. Oster called me to the OKW; Schacht accompanied
me. We asked Canaris again whether he could not arrange another
meeting with Brauchitsch and Halder, but Canaris said to me, “It is
too late now.” He had tears in his eyes and added, “That is the end
of Germany.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, we now come to the war, and I think
that perhaps we had better deal with the war after lunch.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Gisevius, before the noon recess we had just come
to the outbreak of the war, and so that your subsequent testimony
may be understood, I must ask you first in what capacity you served
during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: On the day of the outbreak of war I was called to
Security Intelligence by General Oster by means of a forged order.
However, as it was a regulation that all officers or other members
of the intelligence service had to be examined by the Gestapo, and
as I would never have received permission to be a member of the
intelligence, they simply gave me a forged mobilization order. Then
I was at the disposal of Oster and Canaris without doing any direct
service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And after the outbreak of war what were the activities
of your group of conspirators, the members of which you have
already mentioned? Who took over the leadership, who participated,
and what was done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Immediately after the outbreak of the war Generaloberst
Beck was at the head of all oppositional movements which
could exist in Germany at all, with the exception of the Communists
with whom we had no contact at that time. We were of the opinion
that only a general could be the leader during war, and Beck stood
so far above purely military matters that he was the suitable man
to unify all groups from the left to the right. Beck chose Dr. Goerdeler
as his closest collaborator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Consequently the only civilians who worked with this
group of conspirators were Schacht and Goerdeler as before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, on the contrary; all the opposition groups, who
had so far had merely loose connections with each other, were now
drawn together under the pressure of war. This was especially so
with the left opposition movements, which had been greatly reduced
in the early years as all their leaders had been interned. These left
groups especially now came in with us. In this connection I shall
merely mention Leuschner and Dr. Karl Muehlendorf. However,
I must also mention the Christian Trade Unions, and Dr. Habermann,
and Dr. Jacob Kaiser. Further I must mention the Catholic
circles, the leaders of the Confessional Church, and individual political
men such as Ambassador Von Hassell, State Secretary Planck,
Minister Popitz, and many, many others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What was the attitude of these left circles, especially
concerning the question of a revolt, the forceful removal of Hitler
or even an attempt on his life? Did they also consider the possibility
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
of an attempt at assassination, which later was actually suggested
in your group?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, the left circles were very much under the impression
that the “stab in the back” legend had done much harm in
Germany; and the left circles thought that they ought not to expose
themselves again to the danger of having it said later that Hitler or
the German Army had not been defeated on the battlefield. The left-wing
had long been of the opinion that no matter how bitter an
experience it might be for them, it must now be proved absolutely
to the German people that militarism was committing suicide in
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I have already submitted to the Tribunal, a letter
which you, Doctor, smuggled to Switzerland for Schacht at about
this time—the end of 1939. It is a letter to the former president of
the International Bank at Basel, later president of the First National
Bank of New York; a man of influence, who probably had access
to President Roosevelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In anticipation of the documentary evidence pertaining hereto
I had originally intended to read this letter to the Tribunal now.
However, in discussing the admissibility of evidence I informed the
Tribunal of most of the essential points, and as Mr. Justice Jackson
could not yet have the Schacht Document Book in hand, and as he
remarked previously that he did not like me to produce documentary
evidence at this point, I will not carry out my original intention
to read this letter in its entirety. I will come back to it when I
present my documentary evidence. Just to refresh the witness’
memory about this letter, I will give the underlying reasons for it.
Schacht suggested to President Fraser that now the moment...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I make no objection to the use of the
letter from Schacht to Leon Fraser as one banker writing to another.
If you want to claim that Mr. Fraser was influential with President
Roosevelt, I should want you to prove it; but I have no objection to
the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The letter is dated 14 January 1946. I will not read it
in its entirety, for there are six long pages. Its contents are...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What date was it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I had the wrong letter. The 16 October 1939. It will be
Exhibit Number 31 in my document book. He writes that now
would be an excellent time to give peace to the world with President
Roosevelt—that would be a victory, also a German victory...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is the letter from Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: From Schacht to Fraser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you have proof for the letter?
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: If the Tribunal prefers, Schacht can also deal with the
letter. In that case I will only ask the witness whether it is true
that he smuggled this letter into Switzerland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Please answer the question, Witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I took this letter to Switzerland and mailed it
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well. What did your group do to bring about
peace, or prevent the war from spreading? Did you undertake
further activities in foreign politics in that direction in your
opposition group, that is, your group of conspirators?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The main thing for us was with all possible means to
prevent the war from spreading. It could only spread toward
Holland and Belgium or Norway. We recognized clearly that if a
step was taken in this direction, the consequences, not only for Germany,
but for the whole of Europe would be tremendous. Therefore,
we wanted to prevent war in the West by all means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after the Polish Campaign Hitler decided to move
his troops from the East to the West, and to launch the attack by
violating the neutrality of Holland and Belgium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We believed that if we could succeed in preventing this attack
in November we would in the coming winter months gain enough
time to convince the individual generals, above all Brauchitsch and
Halder and the leaders of the army groups, that they must at least
oppose the expansion of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brauchitsch and Halder evaded the question and said it was
now too late, that the enemy would fight Germany to the end and
destroy her. We did not share this opinion. We believed a peace
with honor was still possible, and by honor I mean that we would
of course eliminate the Nazi hierarchy to the last man. In order to
prove to the generals that the foreign powers did not wish to
destroy the German people, but wanted only to protect themselves
against the Nazi terror, we took all possible steps abroad. The first
attempt in that direction, or a small part of that attempt, was the
letter written by Schacht to Fraser, the object of which was to
point out that certain domestic political developments were imminent
and that if we could gain time, that is, if we could come
through the winter, we could perhaps persuade the generals to
undertake a revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Thank you. May I interrupt you for a moment? I would
like to call the attention of the Tribunal now to the fact that the
witness is referring to a passage, to a suggestion, contained in the
letter. This letter is in English. I have no German translation, and
I must therefore read this sentence in English. “My feeling is that
the earlier discussions be opened, the easier it will be to influence
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
the development of certain existing conditions.” The question
is now...</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I would like to ask you: What did Dr. Schacht mean by the
“certain existing conditions” that were to be influenced? Did he
mean your efforts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I must interpose an objection. I am
not sure whether you have misunderstood it. I think that what
Schacht meant is not a question to be addressed to this witness.
I shall have no objection to Dr. Schacht telling us what he meant by
his cryptic language, but I don’t think that this witness can interpret
what Schacht meant unless he has some information apart from
anything that now appears. I don’t want to be over technical about
this, but it does seem to me that this is the sort of question which
should be reserved for Dr. Schacht himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Mr. Justice Jackson, of course, is right, but this witness
said that he smuggled the letter into Switzerland, and I assume that
he discussed the contents of the letter with Schacht and was therefore
in a position to explain the cryptic words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He didn’t say this yet; he hasn’t said he ever
saw the letter except the outside of it. He hasn’t said he ever saw
the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Will you please tell us whether you saw the letter and
knew its contents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I am sorry that I did not so clearly at once, but
I helped in drafting the letter. I was there when the letter was
drafted and written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then I believe Justice Jackson will withdraw his
objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Will you please answer my question; what is meant by
those cryptic words?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We wanted to suggest that we, in Germany, were
interested in forcing certain developments and that we now expected
an encouraging word from the other side. I do not, however, want
any misunderstanding to arise here. In this letter it also states very
clearly that President Roosevelt had in the meantime been disappointed
many times by the German side, so that we had to beg,
to urge him to take such a step. It is a fact that President Roosevelt
had taken various steps for peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Let us go on now. If I give you the cue “Vatican
Action”?...
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In addition to this attempt to enter into discussions
with America, we believed we should ask for a statement from the
British Government. Again it was our aim solely to...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is the original of this letter still available or
is this only given from memory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The original copy, yes; that is, a copy signed by Schacht
is here. It was kept during the war in Switzerland and was brought
back to us from Switzerland by this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Now, let us go on to the “Vatican
Action.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We tried in every possible way to prove to General
Halder and General Olbricht that their theory was wrong, that there
could be no longer a question of dealing with a decent German
government. We believed that we should now follow a particularly
important and safe road. The Holy Father made personal efforts in
these matters, as the British Government had, with justification,
become uncertain whether there really existed in Germany a trustworthy
group of men with whom talks could be undertaken. I
remember that shortly afterwards the Venlo incident took place
when, with the excuse that there was a German opposition group,
officials of the English Secret Service were kidnapped at the Dutch
border. Therefore, we were anxious to prove that there was a group
here which was honestly trying to do its best and which, if the
occasion arose, would stand by its word under all circumstances.
I believe that we kept our word regarding the things we proposed
to do, while we said quite frankly that we could not bring about
this revolt as we had said previously we hoped to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These negotiations began in October—November 1939. They were
only concluded later in the spring, and if I am asked I will continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, please describe the conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe I must add first that, during November of
1939, General Halder actually had intended a revolt, but that these
intentions for a revolt again came to naught because at the very last
minute Hitler called off the western offensive. Strengthened by the
attitude of Halder at that time, we believed that we should continue
these discussions at the Vatican. We reached what you might call
a gentleman’s agreement, on the grounds of which I believe that I
am entitled to state that we could give the generals unequivocal
proof that in the event of the overthrow of the Hitler regime, an
agreement could be reached with a decent civil German government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you read the documents yourself, Doctor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: These were oral discussions which were then written
down in a comprehensive report. This report was read by the Ambassador
Von Hassell and by Dr. Schacht before it was given to
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
Halder by General Thomas. Halder was so taken aback by the contents
that he gave this comprehensive report to Generaloberst Von
Brauchitsch. Brauchitsch was enraged and threatened to arrest the
intermediary, General Thomas, and thus this action which had every
prospect of success, failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Doctor, you have testified...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, the last notes that I have got down
in my notebook are these: “That we knew that if Holland, Belgium,
and the other countries were attacked, it would have very grave
consequences and we therefore negotiated with Halder and Brauchitsch
and they weren’t prepared to help us to stop the war at
that time. We wanted peace with honor, eliminating politics. We
took all possible steps.” Well, now, since I took these notes down,
I think we spent nearly 10 minutes in details, which are utterly
irrelevant, about further negotiations. If they took all possible steps,
what is the point of giving us these details about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, Your Lordship, if a witness is called in a matter
of such importance, where he as well as the defendants’ counsel
must always take into account that people who are of a different
opinion may say “these are just generalities, we want facts and
particulars,” then I cannot forego having the witness testify at least
in broad outline that, for example, a detailed action had been undertaken
through His Holiness in the Vatican. If he merely says that
the result of this action was a comprehensive report, if with Halder
and Brauchitsch the above mentioned...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I agree with you that the one sentence about
some negotiations with the Vatican may have been properly given,
but all the rest of it were unnecessary details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Anyway we have already concluded this chapter, Your
Lordship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] You have already testified that the
revolt which was planned for November did not occur because the
western offensive did not take place. Therefore, we need not pursue
this subject any further. I would merely like to ask you at this
point: Did your group of conspirators remain inactive during the
winter, and particularly during the spring, or were further plans
followed and acted upon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Constant attempts were made to influence all generals
within our reach. Besides Halder and Brauchitsch we tried to
reach the generals of the armored divisions in the West. I remember,
for instance, there was a discussion between Schacht and General
Hoeppner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Hoeppner?
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Hoeppner. We also tried to influence Field Marshal
Rundstedt, Bock, and Leeb. Here, too, General Thomas and Admiral
Canaris were the intermediaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And how did the generals react?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: When everything was ready, they would not start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, we come to the summer of 1941. Hitler is in
Paris. The aerial offensive against England is imminent. Tell us
about your group of conspirators and their activity during this
period and the period following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: After the fall of Paris, our group had no influence at
all for months. Hitler’s success deluded everyone, and it took much
effort on our part, through all channels available, to try at least to
prevent the bombardment of England. Here again the group made
united efforts and we tried, through General Thomas and Admiral
Canaris and others, to prevent this evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Do I understand you correctly, when you use the word
“group” you mean the group which was led by Beck, in which
Schacht collaborated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, at that time did Schacht have several talks, or
one talk, along the same line in Switzerland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was a little later. We have now come to the
year 1941, and on this trip to Switzerland Schacht tried to urge that
a peace conference should be held as soon as possible. We knew that
Hitler was thinking about the attack on Russia, and we believed
that we should do everything to avert at least this disaster. With
this thought in mind Schacht’s discussions in Switzerland were conducted.
I myself took part in arranging a dinner in Basel with the
president of the B. I. Z., Mr. McKittrick, an American, and I was
present when Schacht tried to express at least the opinion that
everything possible must now be done to initiate negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In this connection I would respectfully like to remind
the Tribunal of the article in the <span class='it'>Basler Nachrichten</span>, of which I
presented the essential contents when we discussed the admissibility
of the document. It deals with a similar conversation between
Schacht and an American economist. That is the same trip which
the witness is now discussing. I will take the liberty of referring to
this article later, when presenting documentary evidences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Now, the war continued. Do you have
anything to say about Russia; about the imminent war with Russia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I can say only that Schacht knew of all the many
attempts which we undertook to avert this catastrophe.
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now let us go further to the time of Stalingrad. What
was done by your group of conspirators after this critical period
of the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: When we did not succeed in persuading the victorious
generals to engineer a revolt, we then tried at least to win them
over to one when they had obviously come up against their great
catastrophe. This catastrophe, which found its first visible signs in
Stalingrad, had been predicted in all its details by Generaloberst
Beck since December of 1942. We immediately made all preparations
so that at the moment, which could be forecast with almost mathematical
exactitude, when the army of Paulus, completely defeated,
would have to capitulate, then at least a military revolt could be
organized. I myself was called back from Switzerland and participated
in all discussions and preparations. I can only testify that
this time a great many preparations were made. Contact was also
made with the field marshals in the East, with Witzleben in the
West but again, things turned out differently, for Field Marshal
Paulus capitulated instead of giving us the cue at which Kluge,
according to plan, was to start the revolt in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: This was the time of the so-called Schlaberndorff
attempt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, a little later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now I shall interpose another question. Until now you
have always described the group led by Generaloberst Beck and
supported by Schacht, Goerdeler, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, as a revolt movement,
that is, a group which wanted to overthrow the government. Did
you not now more and more aim at an assassination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, from the moment when the generals again
deserted us, we realized that a revolt was not to be hoped for, and
from that moment on we took all the steps we could to instigate an
assassination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANS LATERNSER (Counsel for General Staff and High
Command of the German Armed Forces): Mr. President, I must
object at this point to the testimony of the witness. The witness,
Dr. Gisevius, by his testimony has incriminated the group which
I represent. However, some of this testimony is so general that it
cannot be referred to as fact. Furthermore, he has just testified that
the field marshals in the East had “deserted” the group of conspirators.
These statements are opinions which the witness is giving,
but they are not facts, to which the witness must limit his testimony,
and therefore I ask—Mr. President, I have not yet finished.
I wanted to conclude with the request for a resolution by the Court
that the testimony given by the witness, where he asserted that the
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
generals had “deserted” the group of conspirators, be stricken from
the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I please reply briefly? I cannot agree with the
opinion of my esteemed colleague Dr. Laternser that the statement
“the generals deserted us” was not a statement of fact...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think we need to hear further argument
upon it. It certainly won’t be stricken from the record until
we have had time to consider it, and Dr. Laternser will have his
opportunity of examining this witness, and he can then elucidate
any evidence he wants to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: But, Mr. President, if I make the motion for
the reason that the witness is giving testimony which is beyond his
scope as a witness, and that he is giving his opinion, then to that
extent it is inadmissible testimony which would have to be stricken
from the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you mean that the evidence is hearsay,
that will be perfectly obvious to the Tribunal, and doesn’t make the
evidence inadmissible, and you will be able to cross-examine him
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I have been misunderstood. I
did not say, and I am not basing my request to strike the testimony
from the record on the allegation that the witness made statements
from hearsay; but I say that it is not a statement of fact, but an
opinion which the witness is giving when he says that “the generals
in the East deserted the group of conspirators.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I answer briefly to that? If I try to influence a
group of generals to organize a revolt and if they do not do so, that
is a fact and I can state this fact with the words, “They deserted us.”
Naturally I can also say, “They did not revolt,” but that is merely a
matter of expression. Both are facts and not an opinion. He is not
appraising the behavior of the generals in an ethical, military, or
political sense, he is merely pointing out, “They were not willing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] If I recall correctly, you were
just about to tell us that now the policy of the conspirators’ group
changed from a revolt to an assassination. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Do you wish to state anything further?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: You had asked me about the first step in this direction
after Generaloberst Beck had given up all hope of being able
to win over another general to a revolt. It was said at that time
that there was now nothing left for us but to free Germany, Europe,
and the world from the tyrant by a bomb attack. Immediately after
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
this decision, preparations were started. Oster spoke to Lahousen
and Lahousen furnished the bombs from his arsenal. The bombs
were taken to the headquarters of Kluge at Smolensk, and with
every possible means we tried to bring about the assassination,
which was unsuccessful only because at a time when Hitler was
visiting the front, the bomb which had been put in his airplane did
not explode. This was in the spring of 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, an event took place in the Abwehr OKW, which
as a result of further developments, strongly affected Schacht’s
further attitude and also your remaining in Germany. Will you
please describe that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Gradually even Himmler could not fail to see what
was happening in the OKW, and at the urgent request of SS General
Schellenberg a thorough investigation of the Canaris group was
now started. A special commissioner was appointed and on the first
day of this investigation Oster was relieved of his post and a number
of his collaborators were arrested. A short time afterwards Canaris
was also dismissed from his post. I myself could no longer remain
in Germany and thus this group, which until now had in a certain
sense been the directorate of all the conspiracies, was eliminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: During that time, that is January 1943, Schacht was
also relieved of his position as Reich Minister without Portfolio. Did
you meet Schacht after that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. By chance I was in Berlin on the day this letter
of dismissal arrived. It was an unusually sharp letter and I remember
that that night I was asked to the country house of Schacht, and as
the letter had simply stated that Schacht was to be dismissed, we
wondered whether he was also going to be arrested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I would like to remind the Tribunal that I read this
letter into the record when Lammers was examined and showed it
to him. This letter—I mean Schacht’s letter of dismissal signed by
Lammers—has already been read into the record and is probably
contained in my document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] You were in Switzerland at that time,
but on 20 July you were in Berlin. How did that happen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean the 20th of July 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, the well-known day of the 20th of July. We are
rapidly approaching the end now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: A few months after the elimination of the Canaris-Oster
circle we formed a new group around General Olbricht. At
that time Colonel Count Von Stauffenberg also joined us. He
replaced Oster in all activities, and when after several months, and
after many unsuccessful attempts and discussions, the time finally
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
arrived in July 1944, I returned secretly to Berlin in order to participate
in the events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: But you had no direct connection with Schacht at this
attempted assassination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No; I, personally, was in Berlin secretly and saw
only Goerdeler, Beck, and Stauffenberg; and it was agreed expressly
at this time that no other civilian except Goerdeler, Leuschner, and
myself were to be informed of the matter. We hoped thus to protect
lives by not burdening anyone unnecessarily with this knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now I come to my last question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You know that Schacht had after all held high government
positions under the Hitler regime. You, Doctor, as is shown by your
testimony today were an arch enemy of the Hitler regime. Despite
that you had, as can also be seen from your testimony today, special
confidence in Schacht. How do you explain this fact which at first
sight seems to be contradictory in itself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: My answer can, of course, only express a personal
opinion and I will formulate it as briefly as possible. However, I
would like to emphasize that the problem of Schacht was confusing
not only to me but to my friends as well; Schacht was always a
problem and a puzzle to us. Perhaps it was due to the contradictory
nature of this man that he kept his position in the Hitler
government for so long. He undoubtedly entered the Hitler regime
for patriotic reasons, and I would like to testify here that the
moment his disappointment became obvious he decided for the
same patriotic reasons to join the opposition. Despite Schacht’s
many contradictions and the puzzles he gave us to solve, my friends
and I were strongly attracted to Schacht because of his exceptional
personal courage and the fact that he was undoubtedly a man of
strong moral character, and he did not think only of Germany but
also of the ideals of humanity. That is why we went with him,
why we considered him one of us; and, if you ask me personally, I
can say that the doubts which I often had about him were completely
dispelled during the dramatic events of 1938 and 1939. At
that time he really fought, and I will never forget that. It is a
pleasure for me to be able to testify to this here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, I am now through with the questioning
of this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other member of the defendants
counsel want to ask questions of the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR GEORG BÖHM (Counsel for SA): Witness, yesterday
you said that you were a member of the Stahlhelm. When and for
how long were you a member?
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I entered the Stahlhelm in 1929, I believe, and left
that organization in 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: You know the mentality of the members of the
Stahlhelm. You know that, almost without exception, they were
people who had served in the first World War, and I would like to
ask you now whether the internal and foreign political goals of the
Stahlhelm were to be reached by its members in a legal or in a
revolutionary manner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: To my knowledge the Stahlhelm always favored the
legal way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Yes. Was the fight of the Stahlhelm against the
Treaty of Versailles which every organization with national tendencies
took up, to be carried on by legal or revolutionary means, or
means of force?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It is very hard for me to answer for the entire
Stahlhelm, but I can only say that I, and the members of the Stahlhelm
organization with whom I was acquainted, knew that the
Stahlhelm wanted to take the legal way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Is it correct to say that in the year 1932 and 1933
hundreds of thousands, regardless of party and race, entered the
Stahlhelm organization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That is correct. The more critical matters became in
Germany, the more people went to the right. I myself having experienced
this growth of the Stahlhelm as an official speaker at
public meetings, from 1929 to 1933, I would describe it in this way:
That those who did not want to join the NSDAP and the SA, deliberately
entered the Stahlhelm so that within the German rightist
movement there would be a counterbalance against the rising
“brown” tide. That was the underlying reason of our recruitment
for the Stahlhelm at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: You know, of course, that in the year 1933 the
Stahlhelm organization as a whole was taken into the SA. Was it
possible at that time for the individual member of the Stahlhelm
to say “no,” or to protest against being taken over into the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was possible, of course, as everything was
possible also in the Third Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: What would have been the possible consequences
of such a step?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The possible consequences would have been a violent
discussion with the regional Party leaders or SA leaders. At that
time I was no longer a member of the Stahlhelm and I can merely
say that it undoubtedly must have been very difficult for many
people, particularly those living in the country, to refuse being
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
transferred to the SA. After they had been betrayed by their
leader, Minister Seldte, or as it was said at that time “sold” to the
SA, refusal to transfer to the SA was naturally a sign of open
distrust toward National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: I gather from my correspondence with the former
members of the Stahlhelm, that these people who, as former
members of the Stahlhelm, were taken into the SA, remained a
foreign body in it and were in constant opposition to the NSDAP
and the SA. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As I myself no longer belonged to that organization,
I can only say that I assume that those members of the Stahlhelm
felt very uneasy in their new surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Do you know whether the members of the Stahlhelm,
before 1934 and from 1934, participated in Crimes against
Peace, against the Jews, against the Church, and so forth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I know nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Now I would also like to question you about the
SA as far as you are able to give information. Yesterday at least
you expressed yourself freely with regard to the SA leaders. I
would like to ask you, in replying to a question I shall now ask, to
confine yourself to a circle of SA members which lies between the
simple SA man and the Standartenführer or the Brigadeführer.
Could you tell from the attitude and activity of the ordinary SA
man and that of the Standartenführer or Brigadeführer—and I
do not go beyond that limit because I well remember the statements
you made yesterday concerning the Gruppenführer or Obergruppenführer—that
these people intended to commit Crimes against Peace?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It is, of course, very difficult to answer such a
general question. If you ask me about the majority of these SA
men, I can only say no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Witness, did you notice that SA men were
arrested and that SA men were also put into concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I saw that many times. In 1933, 1934, and 1935, that
was in the years when it was my official duty to deal with these
matters, many SA men were arrested by the Gestapo, beaten to
death, or at least tortured, and put into concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Could a man, who was in the SA, or anyone
outside for that matter, judge the SA as a whole from the activity
of its members, or from individual cases, and gather that the SA
intended to commit Crimes against Peace?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No. When I consider what efforts even we in the
High Command of the Wehrmacht had to make to try and discover
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
whether or not Hitler was planning a war, I naturally cannot attribute
to a simple SA man knowledge of something which we ourselves
did not know for certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: The Prosecution asserted that the SA incited the
youth and the German people to war. Did you observe anything
of that nature? You were a member of the Gestapo and such
activities could not have escaped your notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That is another extremely general question, and I
do not know to what extent certain songs, and other things, can
be considered a preparation for war. At any rate I cannot imagine
that the mass of the SA was of a different frame of mind than the
mass of the German people in the years up to 1938, and the general
trend of opinion beyond a doubt was that the mere thought of war
was absolute madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Was there anything that made you think that
the SA intended to commit Crimes against Peace, or that they had
committed such crimes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As far as the ordinary SA man is concerned, I must
say “no” again, and I say the same for the mass of the SA. I could
not say to what extent the higher leaders were involved in plotting
all the horrible things we have heard about here, but the majority
undoubtedly did not know of such things and were not trained for
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Witness, it cannot be denied that mistakes were
made by a number of SA men, and criminal acts were committed
for which these people certainly should be punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You know the SA and know what took place during the revolutionary
period and afterwards. Are you in a position to estimate
or to give a proportional figure as to what percentage of the
numerous members of the SA conducted themselves in a punishable
manner? I call your attention to the fact that up to, perhaps 1932
or 1933, the SA...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just a moment, Dr. Böhm. The Tribunal
doesn’t think that is a proper question to put to a witness, what
percentage of a group of this sort, of hundreds of thousands of men,
take a certain view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: However the explanation of this question would
be very important for my case, Mr. President. Here is a witness
who was outside the SA, who as a member of the Gestapo was
perhaps one of the few people who could look into the activities
of the SA, and actually did look into them, and he will certainly
be believed by the Tribunal. He knew fairly well what criminal
procedures were carried out and also—and that is what I want to
say—the number of members of the SA, and he is one of the few
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
who are in a position to testify on this matter. I believe that if the
witness is in a position to testify hereto, the testimony given by him
will be of great importance to the Tribunal also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has already ruled that not only
this witness, but other witnesses, are not in a position to give such
evidence, and the question is denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Witness, do you know of cases in which SA
members worked in opposition to the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I answered that question when I said that quite a
number of SA members were arrested by the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Yes. Do you know what criminal proceedings
were taken against the members of the SA, and possibly how many?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Far too few, I am sorry to say, if you put it that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Unfortunately there were many who committed
misdeeds in the SA and who went scot-free. I am sorry that I must
answer in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Certainly. And in what relation do they stand
to the entire SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Now we have come again to the question...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is the same question over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Do you know under what circumstances one
could resign from the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In the same manner as one could resign from all
organizations of the Party. That was, of course, a brave decision
to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERR BÖHM: Thank you. I have no further question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, in replying to a question of my
colleague Dr. Dix, you told the Tribunal that after the defeat at
Stalingrad a military revolt was to be organized. You testified on
this point that discussions had already taken place, that preparations
had been made, and that the execution of the military revolt
was prevented because the field marshals in the East had deserted
the group of conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask you now to give us more details on this question so that I
can understand why you came to the conclusion that the field
marshals had deserted the conspiracy group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: From the outbreak of the war Generaloberst Beck
tried to contact one field marshal after another. He wrote letters
and he sent messengers to them. I particularly remember the correspondence
with General Field Marshal Von Manstein, and I saw
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
with my own eyes General Von Manstein’s answer of the year 1942.
To Beck’s strictly military explanations that the war had been lost
and why, Manstein could reply only: A war is not lost until one
considers it as lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beck said that with an answer like that from a field marshal
strategic questions could certainly not be raised. Several months
later another attempt was made to win General Field Marshal Von
Manstein. General Von Tresckow, also a victim of the 20th of July,
went to the headquarters of Manstein. Oberstleutnant Count Von
der Schulenburg also went to the headquarters of Manstein, but we
did not succeed in winning Herr Von Manstein to our side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of Stalingrad we contacted Field Marshal Von Kluge,
and he, in his turn, contacted Manstein. This time discussions
reached a point when Kluge definitely assured us that he would
win over Field Marshal Von Manstein at a discussion definitely
fixed to take place in the Führer’s headquarters. Because of the
importance of that day, a special telephone line was laid by the
General of the Signal Corps, Fellgiebel, between the headquarters
and General Olbricht at the OKW in Berlin. I myself was present
when this telephone conversation took place. Even today I can
still see that paper which said, in plain language, that Manstein,
contrary to his previous assurances, had allowed himself to be
persuaded by Hitler to remain in office. And even Kluge expressed
himself as satisfied at the time with very small military strategic
concessions. This was a bitter disappointment to us, and, therefore,
I would like to repeat again what Beck said at that time: “We were
deserted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: What further preparations had been made in
this special connection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We had made definite agreements with Field Marshal
Von Witzleben. Witzleben was the Commander-in-Chief in the West,
and therefore he was very important for starting or protecting a
revolt in the West. We had made further definite agreements with
the Military Governor of Belgium, Generaloberst Von Falkenhausen.
In addition, as on 20 July 1944, we had assembled a certain contingent
of armored troops in the vicinity of Berlin. Furthermore,
those commanders of the troops who were to participate in the
action had been assembled in the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: All this happened after Stalingrad?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At the time of the Stalingrad revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Please continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We had made all other political preparations which
were necessary. It is difficult for me to tell here the entire story
of the revolts against the Third Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes. What were the reasons why this intended
military revolt was not carried through?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: What was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, what were the reasons why this
revolt, which was intended by the group of conspirators, was not
carried through?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Contrary to all expectations, Field Marshal Paulus
capitulated. This, as is known, was the first wholesale capitulation
of generals; whereas we had expected that Paulus with his generals
would issue, before his capitulation, a proclamation to the German
people and to the East Front, in which the strategy of Hitler and
the sacrifice of the Stalingrad army would be branded in suitable
words. When this cue had been given, Kluge was to declare that
in future he would take no further military orders from Hitler. We
hoped with this plan to circumvent the problem of the military
oath which kept troubling us more and more; the field marshals one
after the other were to refuse military obedience to Hitler, whereupon
Beck was to take over the supreme military command in
Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, you just mentioned the military oath.
Do you know whether Blomberg and Generaloberst Beck opposed,
or tried to oppose, the pledge the Armed Forces took to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I know only that Beck up to the last day of his life
considered the day he gave his pledge to Hitler as the blackest day
of his existence, and he gave me an exact description of how completely
taken unawares he had felt at the rendering of the oath.
He told me that he had been summoned to a military roll call; and
that suddenly it was announced that an oath of allegiance was to
be given to the new head of State; that unexpectedly a new form
of oath was to be used. Beck could never rid himself of the awful
thought that at that time he perhaps should not have given his oath.
He told me that while he was on his way home, he said to a
comrade, “This is the blackest day of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, in your testimony, you also mentioned
that between the Polish campaign and the Western campaign,
or with the beginning of the Western campaign, a further military
Putsch was to be attempted, and that this Putsch failed because
Halder and Field Marshal Von Brauchitsch shirked it. You used the
term “shirked” previously in your testimony. Now I ask you to tell
me on the basis of what facts did you arrive at this opinion that
both these generals shirked...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I do not raise an objection that this
is harmful to us if we have plenty of time, but this evidence as to
these Putsche, and threatened Putsche, and rumored Putsche, was
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
all admissible here in our view only as bearing on the attitude of
the Defendant Schacht. We are not trying these generals for being
in a Putsch or not being in a Putsch. For all purposes it is just as
well as they should not be in a Putsch. I do not know what purposes
this can have in doing it over again. I call the Tribunal’s
attention for the limited purpose for which this historical matter
was admitted, and suggest that it is serving no purpose in this
connection to review it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the answer to that, Dr. Laternser?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Since the witness has talked about this
matter and testified that Halder as well as Brauchitsch shirked, and
I cannot establish whether the opinion expressed by this witness
with “shirked” is correct on the basis of the facts, I think I am
obliged to clarify this point. In a general sense I would like to add
further that the Prosecution is also justified in going into this point.
I refer to the contention of the French Prosecutor in which he
stated that in the light of all these circumstances it was beyond
comprehension why Halder, as well as the entire German nation,
did not rise as one man against the regime. Therefore, if I start
from the viewpoint of the Prosecution, then my question on this
point, as I have just put it, is undoubtedly of importance, and I,
therefore, ask that this question be permitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The charge against the High Command is
that they were a criminal organization within the meaning of the
Charter; that is to say that they planned an aggressive war, or that
they committed War Crimes or Crimes against Humanity in connection
with an aggressive war. Well, whether or not they took part,
or were planning to take part in a Putsch to stop the war does not
seem very material to any of those questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: I agree with you entirely on this point,
Mr. President, that it cannot actually be considered of special importance;
but on the other hand...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I did not say that it was not of special importance.
I say that it was not material to the relevancy. The
Tribunal does not think that any of these questions are relevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Then I will withdraw my question. I have
one final question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, can you tell me the names
of those generals who participated on the 20th of July?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, what has that got to do with any
charge against the High Command?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: The General Staff is accused of having participated
in a conspiracy. The question...
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We are not here to consider the honor of the
High Command. We are here to consider whether or not they are
a criminal organization within the meaning of the Charter, and
that is the only question with which we are going to deal as far as
you are concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, the General Staff and the OKW
are accused of having participated in a conspiracy. If I prove, as
I am trying to do with this question, that on the contrary, instead
of participating in a conspiracy, part of the General Staff took part
in an action against the regime, then the answer to this question
on this point indicates that precisely the opposite was the case;
and, for that reason, I ask that the question be permitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not think what the
General Staff did in July 1944, when the circumstances were
entirely different to what they were in September 1939, has any
relevancy to the question whether they took part, either before or
in September 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, if I put myself in the place of
the Prosecution, I must assume that the Prosecution assumes that
the conspiracy continued. It cannot be inferred, from testimony by
the Prosecution or from anything that has been submitted, that the
conspiracy was to have stopped at a certain period of time. So that
the answer to this question would be of importance, I believe of
decisive importance. I would like to supplement my statement,
Mr. President...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Laternser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: I would like to add that it is precisely for
the members of the group I represent that the period of time between
1938 and May 1940 is considered decisive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean the group changed; therefore,
they might be different in 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: I wish to add that a particularly large number
of the members of this group only joined it in the course of 1944
because of their official positions, and I do consider this point important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: All right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, my question was: Can you give me
the names of those generals who participated in the attempted
assassination of the 20th of July 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Generaloberst Beck, General Field Marshal Von
Witzleben, General Olbricht, General Hoeppner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: One question: General Hoeppner was previously
commander-in-chief of an armored army?
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe so; General Von Haase, and certainly a
large number of other generals whom I cannot enumerate offhand.
Here I have mentioned only the names of those who were at
Bendlerstrasse that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: One question, Witness: Do you know whether
Field Marshal Rommel also participated on the 20th of July 1944?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I cannot answer by merely saying “yes,” for it is
a fact that Rommel, as well as Field Marshal Von Kluge, did participate.
However, it would give a wrong picture if Field Marshal
Rommel were suddenly to appear in the category of those who
fought against Hitler. Herr Rommel, as a typical Party general,
sought to join us very late, and it gave us a very painful impression
when suddenly Herr Rommel in the face of his own military
catastrophe, proposed to us to have Hitler assassinated, and then, if
possible, Göring and Himmler as well. And, even then, he did not
want to join in at the first opportunity, but wanted to stay somewhat
in the background in order to allow us to profit by his popularity
later on. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to know whether
these gentlemen, when they joined our group, came as the fallen
might, as people who wished to save their pensions, or as people
who, from the beginning, stood for decency and honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Did you yourself ever speak to Field Marshal
Rommel about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No. I never considered it worth while to make his
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: A further question: Did officers of the General
Staff participate in the 20th of July?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, a great number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: About how many would you say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I cannot give you the number, for at that time I
was not informed of how many of the General Staff Stauffenberg
had on his side. I do not doubt that Stauffenberg, Colonel Hansen,
and several other stout-hearted men had discovered a number of
clean, courageous officers among the General Staff, and that they
could count on the support of very many decent members of the
General Staff, but whom they naturally could not initiate into their
plans beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, that will be sufficient for this point.
Another question has occurred to me. You mentioned General
Von Tresckow previously. Did you know General Von Tresckow
personally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Do you know anything about the fact that,
after he learned that the commissar decree had been issued, General
Von Tresckow remonstrated with Rundstedt and that these remonstrances
contributed to the fact that the commissar decree was not
passed on in General Field Marshal Von Rundstedt’s sector?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Tresckow belonged to our group for many years.
There was no action which made us so ashamed as this one, and
from the very start he courageously called the attention of his
superiors to the inadmissibility of such terrible decrees. I remember
how at that time we learned of the famous commissar decree at
first through hearsay, and we immediately sent a courier to Tresckow
to inform him simply of the intention of such an outrage, and how
after the decree had been published, Tresckow, at a given signal,
remonstrated with General Field Marshal Von Rundstedt in the
way you described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You said a while ago that you were just
going to ask your last question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I am sorry I could not keep
to that. A number of questions arose from the testimony of the
witness, but this was my last question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other member of the defendants’
counsel wish to ask any questions of the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then do the Prosecution desire to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May it please the Tribunal, I have a
few questions to put to you, Dr. Gisevius, and if you will answer
them as nearly as possible, “yes” or “no,” as you are capable of
giving a truthful answer, you will save a great deal of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal perhaps should know your relations with the
Prosecution. Is it not a fact that within 2 months of the surrender
of Germany I met you at Wiesbaden, and you related to me your
experiences in the conspiracy that you have related here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you were later brought here,
and after coming here were interrogated by the Prosecution as well
as by the counsel for Frick and for Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, your attitude and viewpoint
are, as I understand you, those of a German who felt that loyalty to
the German people required continuous opposition to the Nazi
regime. Is that a correct statement of your position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you had a very large experience
in police matters in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If your Putsche or other moves to
obtain power in Germany were successful, it was planned that you
would be in charge of the police in the reorganization, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Either as Minister of the Interior or
as Police Commissioner, whatever it might be called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you represented the belief that
it was not necessary to govern Germany with concentration camps
and with Gestapo methods; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you found all of the ways of presenting
your viewpoint to the German people cut off by the Gestapo
methods which were used by the Nazi regime; is that a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: So that there was no way open to
you to obtain any change in German policy except through revolt
or assassination, or means of that kind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No. I am convinced that until 1937 or the beginning
of 1938 the position could have been changed in Germany by a
majority of votes in the Reich Cabinet or through pressure by the
Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you fix 1937 as the time when
it ceased to be possible by peaceful means to effect a change in
Germany; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That is how I would judge it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, it was not until after 1937 that
Schacht joined your group; is that not a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, as I said, the group was not formed until 1937,
1938; but Schacht had already introduced me to Goerdeler in 1936,
and Schacht and Oster had known each other since 1936. And
naturally Schacht had also known a large number of other members
of the group for a long time.
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But Schacht did not become convinced,
as I understand your statement to us, until after 1937—until
the Putsch affair—that he wouldn’t be able to handle Hitler in some
peaceful way; is that not correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In what manner? In a peaceful manner or...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In a peaceful manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, until the end of 1937 Schacht believed that it
ought to be possible to remove Hitler legally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But by the end of 1937, as you now
say, the possibility of a peaceful removal of Hitler had become
impossible in fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that is what we thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes; now, there was, as I understand
your view in going to the general—there was no power in Germany
that could stop or deal with the Gestapo, except the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I would answer that question in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is, in addition to the Gestapo,
this Nazi regime also had a private army in the SS, did they not?
And, for a period, in the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And if you were to combat successfully
the Nazi regime, you had to have manpower which only the
Army had; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, only people who could be found in the Army;
but at the same time we also attempted to influence certain people
in the Police, and we needed all the decent officials in the ministries,
and the broad masses of the people altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But the Wehrmacht was the source
of power capable of dealing with the SS and the Gestapo if the
generals had been willing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was our conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that is the reason you kept
seeking the help of the generals and felt let down when they
wouldn’t give you their assistance finally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, there came a time when everybody
connected with your group knew that the war was lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that was before these plots on
Hitler’s life, and it was apparent before the Schlaberndorff plot
and before the July 20th plot, that the war was lost, was it not?
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should like to make it quite clear that there was
no one in our group who did not already know, even when the war
started, that Hitler would never win this war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But it became very much more
apparent as time went on, not only that the war could not be won
by Germany, but that Germany was going to be physically
destroyed as a result of the war; is that not true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yet, under the system which the Nazi
regime had installed, you had no way of changing the course of
events in Germany except by assassination or a revolt; is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And so you resorted to those extreme
measures, knowing that Hitler could never make peace with the
Allies; is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And your purpose in this was to save
Germany the last destroying blows, which unfortunately she
received, from the point of view of the Germans; is that not a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should like to say that actually since the beginning
of the war, we no longer thought only of Germany. I think that
I may say that we bore a heavy share of responsibility towards
Germany and towards the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, what you were endeavoring to
do was to get the war to an end, since you had not been able to
stop its commencement, were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that was impossible as long as
Hitler was at the head of the government and this group of men
behind him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, there was another plot on
Hitler’s life that you haven’t mentioned. Was there not a bomb
that was later found to have been a communist bomb?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: This happened on 9 November 1939, in the Bürgerbräukeller,
in Munich. It was a brave Communist who acted independently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, at none of these times when
Hitler’s life was endangered, by a strange coincidence, was Göring
or Himmler ever present; is that not true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you attach any importance to
that fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We sometimes regretted it. For instance, the attempt
at assassination would perhaps have succeeded, if Göring and
Himmler had been with Hitler on 17 July. But as the years went by,
the members of this clique separated to such an extent, and protected
themselves so much that they could hardly be found together
anywhere. Göring, too, was gradually so absorbed in his transactions
and art collections at Karinhall that he was hardly ever to be
found at a serious conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the assassination of Hitler would
have accomplished nothing from your point of view if the Number 2
man had stepped into Hitler’s place, would it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was a debatable problem for a long time,
because Brauchitsch, for instance, imagined that we could create a
transitional regime with Göring. Our group always refused to come
together with that man even for an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: How did you plan—if you were successful—to
deal with the other defendants here, with the exception
of the Defendant Schacht, all of whom, I understand, you regard as
a part of the Nazi government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: These gentlemen would have been behind lock and
key in an extremely short time, and I think they would not have
had to wait long for their sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, does that apply to every man in
this dock with the exception of Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, every man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is, you recognized them, your
group recognized them all as parts and important parts of the Nazi
regime—a Nazi conspiracy. Is that a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should not like to commit myself to the words
“Nazi conspiracy.” We considered them the men responsible for all
the unspeakable misery which that government had brought to Germany
and the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I should like to ask you a few
questions about the Gestapo. You had testified generally in reference
to the crimes which were committed by that organization and I ask
you to state whether that included the torturing and burning to
death of a large number of persons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The question does not seem to have come through
correctly.
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am asking you as to the crimes committed
by the Gestapo, and I am asking if it included the torturing
and burning to death of thousands of persons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did it involve the unlawful detention
of thousands of innocent people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The throwing of them into concentration
camps where they were tortured and beaten and killed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did the Gestapo engage in wholesale
confiscation of property?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, to a very large extent; they called it “property
of persons hostile to the State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And did it practice extortion against
Jews and against others?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In masses and by the million.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did the Gestapo hinder and molest the
public officials, who were too prominent to be murdered, until they
resigned or were driven from office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The Gestapo used every means, from murder to the
extortion which has just been described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the question arises here as to
whether the members of the Gestapo knew what the Gestapo was
doing; and will you please tell the Tribunal what the situation was
as to the membership in that organization and its knowledge of its
program?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I have already stated at the beginning of my testimony
that from the first or second day every member of the Gestapo
really could not help seeing and knowing what took place in that
institution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, there were some people who
were taken into the Gestapo at the beginning, who were transferred
from other branches of the civil service, were they not; who were
in a sense involuntary members of the Gestapo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes; these members were eliminated in the course of
the first year as being politically unreliable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the transfer took place at the
time Göring set up the Gestapo, did it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What did the witness mean by “eliminated”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think eliminated from the Gestapo.
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Gradually they were released from the service of the
Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, after the purge of the 30th of
June 1934, were special pains taken to see that no one was permitted
in the organization who was not in sympathy with its
program?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: These attempts started after 1 April 1934, when
Himmler and Heydrich took over affairs. Actually, from that date,
no official was allowed into the Gestapo any longer unless Himmler
and Heydrich considered that he held the opinions which they
desired. It may be that during the first months some officials, who
had not yet been screened by the SS, may have got in. The Gestapo
was, of course, a large organization and it naturally took quite a
time until the SS had educated and trained their own criminal
officials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: However, did there come a time, and
if so, will you fix it as nearly as possible, after which every member
of the Gestapo must have known the criminal program of that
organization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: For many years I have considered that question
myself and discussed it with Nebe and my friends. The reply entails
very great responsibility, and in the knowledge of that responsibility
I would say that from the beginning of 1935, at the latest, everyone
must have known what sort of organization he was joining and the
type of orders he might have to expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have testified as to the investigations
which you made when you were connected with the police
administration and you mentioned the Reichstag fire but you did not
tell us what your findings were when you investigated that. Will
you please tell us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: To speak briefly and to begin with the facts, we
ascertained that Hitler in a general way had expressed a wish for
a large-scale propaganda campaign. Goebbels undertook to prepare
the necessary proposals and it was Goebbels who first thought of
setting the Reichstag on fire. Goebbels discussed this with the leader
of the Berlin SA Brigade, Karl Ernst, and he suggested in detail
how it should be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A certain chemical, known to every maker of fireworks, was
chosen. After spraying it, it ignites after a certain time—hours or
minutes. In order to get inside the Reichstag, one had to go through
the corridor leading from the palace of the Reichstag President to
the Reichstag itself. Ten reliable SA men were provided, and then
Göring was informed of all the details of the plan, so that by
chance he did not make an election speech on that particular
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
evening, but at such a late hour would still be sitting at his desk
in the Ministry of the Interior in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Göring—and he gave assurances that he would do so—was to put
the police on wrong trails in the first confusion. From the very
beginning it was intended that the Communists should be accused of
this crime, and the 10 SA men who had to carry out the crime were
instructed accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is, in a few words, the story of the events. To tell you how
we got hold of the details, I have only to add that one of these 10
who had to spray the chemical was a notorious criminal. Six months
later he was dismissed from the SA, and when he did not receive
the reward which he had been promised he decided to tell what he
knew to the Reich Court sitting in Leipzig at the time. He was
taken before an examining magistrate who made a record of his
statement, but the Gestapo heard of it and the letter to the Reich
Court was intercepted and destroyed. The SA man, named Rail,
who betrayed the plan, was murdered in a vile manner with the
knowledge of the Defendant Göring, by order of Gestapo chief Diels.
Through the finding of the body, we picked up the threads of the
whole story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What happened to the 10 SA men
who carried out the Reichstag fire? Are any of them alive now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As far as we are aware none of them are still alive.
Most of them were murdered on 30 June under the pretext of the
Röhm revolt. Only one, a certain Heini Gewaehr, was taken over
by the police as a police officer, and we tracked him down as well.
He was killed in the war, while a police officer on the Eastern Front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think you testified that you also
investigated, with the entire affair of Röhm, the murders that followed
the Röhm affair. Didn’t you so testify?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I cannot actually say that we carried out the investigation,
as we, of the Ministry of the Interior, had really been
excluded from the entire affair. However, matters were such that
after 30 June, all the appeals for help, and all the complaints of
the people who were affected reached us in the Ministry of the
Interior; and during 30 June, through the continual radio messages,
incidental visits to Göring’s palace, and the information received
from Nebe, we discovered all the details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, about how many people were
killed in that purge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We have never been able to establish the number
exactly, but I estimate that no more than 150 to 200 persons lost
their lives, which, at that time, was an enormous figure.
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself with Minister of Justice Gürtner checked the list of the
number of the dead which had been given him by Hitler and
Göring, and we ascertained that the list which contained the names
of 77 dead, who had allegedly been justly killed, was exceeded by
nearly double that number only by those names which we had
received through the prosecuting authorities, or through the appeals
for help coming from relatives to the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, did you ascertain who selected
the men who were killed in that purge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: To begin with we ascertained that Himmler,
Heydrich, and Göring had compiled exact lists of those to be
murdered; for I myself heard in Göring’s palace—and it was confirmed
by Daluege who was present, and also by Nebe who was
present from the very first second—that not one of those who were
killed was mentioned by name; instead they just said: “Number so
and so is now gone,” or, “Number so and so is still missing,” and
“It will soon be Number so and so’s turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, however, no doubt that Heydrich and Himmler also
had a special list. On that special list there were several Catholics,
Klausner, and others. I cannot, for instance, say here under oath
whether Schleicher was murdered by order of Göring, or whether
he was a man who was on Heydrich’s and Himmler’s special list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, was the Defendant Frick fully
informed as to the facts which you knew about the illegal conduct
of the Gestapo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I had to submit to him all the material that
arrived which was important, and I have already described that we
reported all these matters to the Secret State Police or to the
Ministries of the Interior of the Länder. Naturally I could submit
only the most important of these things to Frick personally. I
estimate that I received several hundred such complaints daily, but
the most important had to be submitted to Frick, because he had
to sign them personally; for Göring always complained as soon as
he saw that such a young official signed reports and appeals to the
Ministry and to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, was Frick informed of your
conclusions about the Röhm purge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, because on the Sunday, while the murders were
continuing, I spoke to Frick about the murder of Strasser, Klausner,
Schleicher and the many other murders; and Frick was particularly
disgusted at the murder of Strasser, because he considered that an
act of personal revenge by Göring and Himmler. Likewise, Frick
was extremely indignant about the murders of Klausner, Bose,
Edgar Jung, and the many other innocent men who were murdered.
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But when Frick signed the decree,
along with Hitler, declaring these murders legitimate and ordering
no prosecutions on account of those murders, Frick knew exactly
what had happened from you; is that the fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: He knew it from me, and he had seen it for himself.
The story of the 30th of June was undoubtedly known to Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, did Frick ever talk with you
about Himmler and Heydrich as being bad and dangerous, cruel
persons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: On that Sunday, the 1st of July, Frick said to me,
“If Hitler does not very soon do to the SS and Himmler what he
has done to the SA today, he will experience far worse things with
the SS than he has experienced now with the SA.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was greatly struck by that prediction at the time, and by the
fact that Frick should speak so openly to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But notwithstanding the estimate he
made of those men as dangerous persons, did he not thereafter
appoint them both in his Ministry of Interior?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Well, of course, they were actually appointed by
Hitler. However, I can only say that when I took leave of Frick,
at the time I left the Ministry of the Interior in May 1935, Frick
told me literally that the constant difficulties he had had because
of me had taught him from now on to take Party members only
in his Ministry, and as far as possible those who had the Golden
Party Emblem. He said that it was possible that in the course of
events he might even be forced to allow Himmler into his Ministry,
but in no case would he accept the murderer Heydrich. Those were
the last words I exchanged with Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Both were put in charge of matters
that were under his legal control, were they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, they became members of the Reich Ministry of
the Interior and Frick remained their superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you say that those were the last words
which you exchanged with the Defendant Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. That was in 1935 and I have not met him or
talked to him since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, after 1934 Frick was the
Minister in charge of the running and controlling of concentration
camps, was he not, Dr. Gisevius?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In my opinion the Reich Minister of the Interior
was responsible from the beginning for all police matters in the
Reich and therefore also for the concentration camps, and I do not
believe that one can say he had that responsibility only since 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I am willing to accept your
amendment to my question. I ask that you be shown Document
Number 3751-PS of the United States, which has not yet been
offered in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was submitted to the witness.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, this purports to be a communication from Dr. Gürtner,
the Minister of Justice, to the Reich and Prussian Minister of the
Interior. That would be from your friend Dr. Gürtner to Frick,
would it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe I heard you say “friend.” During the time
he acted as Minister, Gürtner did not conduct himself in such a way
that I could consider him my friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well then, tell us about Gürtner.
Tell us about Gürtner’s position in this situation because we have a
communication here apparently from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Gürtner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At that time Gürtner without doubt made many
attempts to expose the cruelty in the camps and to initiate criminal
proceedings. In individual cases Gürtner did make many attempts;
but after the 30th of June he signed that law which legalized all
those dreadful things, and also in other respects Gürtner never
acted consistently with his views. But this document which you
submit to me was just such an attempt by Gürtner and the many
decent officials in the Ministry of Justice to bring the question of
the Gestapo terror to discussion. As far as I recollect this is one of
those letters which we discussed unofficially beforehand in order
to provoke an answer, so to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I now desire to read some parts of
this into the record. It becomes Exhibit USA-828. I will offer it
as such.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you kindly follow the German text and see if I correctly
quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“My dear Reich Minister!</p>

<p>“Enclosed you will find a copy of a report of the Inspector
of the Secret State Police, dated 28 March 1935.</p>

<p>“This report gives me an occasion to state my fundamental
attitude towards the question of corporal punishment for
internees. The numerous instances of ill-treatment which
have come to the knowledge of the authorities of justice
point to three different reasons for such ill-treatment of
prisoners:</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
“1. Beating as a disciplinary punishment in concentration
camps.</p>

<p>“2. Ill-treatment, mostly of political internees, in order to
make them talk.</p>

<p>“3. Ill-treatment of internees arising out of sheer wantonness
or for sadistic motives.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I think I will not take the Tribunal’s time to read his comment
on Number 1 or Number 2. About Number 3, you will find in the
German text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The experience of the first revolutionary years has shown
that the persons who are charged to administer the beatings
generally lose all sense of the purpose and meaning of their
action after a short time, and permit themselves to be
governed by personal feelings of revenge, or sadistic tendencies.
Thus members of the guard detail of the former concentration
camp at Bredow, near Stettin, completely stripped
a prostitute who had an argument with one of them and beat
her with whips and cowhides in such a fashion that the
woman 2 months later still showed two open and infected
wounds.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not go into the dimensions; they are not important.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the concentration camp at Kemna near Wuppertal,
prisoners were locked up in a narrow clothing locker and were
then tortured by blowing in cigarette smoke, upsetting the
locker, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. In some cases the prisoners were first given
salt herring to eat, in order to produce an especially strong
and torturing thirst.</p>

<p>“In the Hohnstein Concentration Camp in Saxony, prisoners
had to stand under a dripping apparatus especially constructed
for this purpose, until the drops of water, which fell
down at even intervals, caused seriously infected wounds on
their scalps.</p>

<p>“In a concentration camp in Hamburg four prisoners were
lashed in the form of a cross to a grating for days, once
without interruption for 3 days and nights, once for 5 days
and nights and fed so meagerly with dry bread that they
almost died of hunger.</p>

<p>“These few examples show a degree of cruelty which is such
an insult to every German feeling, that it is impossible to
consider any extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, I should like to present my opinion about
these three points to you, my dear Herr Reich Minister, in
your capacity as departmental minister competent for the
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
establishment of protective custody, and the camps for protective
custody.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And he goes on to make certain recommendations for action by
the Minister. I do not know whether the Tribunal cares to have
more of this read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was any improvement in conditions noted after the receipt of
that communication by Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The letter was received just at the time I left the
Ministry of the Interior. I should like to say only one thing concerning
this letter: What is described therein is really only a fraction
of what we knew. I helped prepare this letter in that I spoke
to the officials concerned in the Ministry of Justice. The Minister
of Justice could bring up only those matters which had by chance
become known legally through some criminal record. But there can
be no doubt that this communication was merely a motive, and the
cause of a very bold letter from Heydrich to Göring, dated 28 March
1935, in which he disputed the right of the Minister of Justice to
prosecute cases of ill-treatment. The letter, therefore does not add
anything new to my descriptions, and no doubt all have been convinced
that these conditions, which started at that time, never
ceased but became worse as time went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, there came a time when
Heydrich was assassinated in Prague, was there not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, some very brave Czechs were able to do what
we unfortunately could not achieve. That will always be to their
glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I suppose the Czechs expected,
and did you expect that the assassination of Heydrich would result
in some improvement in this condition?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We doubted—we, Canaris, Oster, Nebe, and the
others of the group—whether it was possible at all for an even
worse man to be found to succeed such a monster as Heydrich, and
to that extent we really did think that the Gestapo terror would
now subside, and that perhaps we would return to a certain amount
of honesty and integrity, or that at least the cruelties might be
lessened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then came Kaltenbrunner. Did
you notice any improvement after the appointment of Kaltenbrunner?
Tell us about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Kaltenbrunner came and things became worse from
day to day. More and more we learned that perhaps the impulsive
actions of a murderer like Heydrich were not so bad as the cold,
legal logic of a lawyer who took over the administration of such a
dangerous instrument as the Gestapo.
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Can you tell us whether Kaltenbrunner
took an even more sadistic attitude than Himmler and
Schellenberg had done? Were you informed about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I know that Heydrich, in a certain sense,
really had something akin to a bad conscience when he committed
his crimes. At any rate, he did not like it when those things were
discussed openly in Gestapo circles. Nebe, who as Chief of the
Criminal Police had the same rank as the Chief of the Gestapo,
Müller, always told me that Heydrich took care to conceal his
crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the entry of Kaltenbrunner into that organization, this
practice ceased. All those things were now openly discussed among
the department chiefs of the Gestapo. By now the war had started,
of course. These gentlemen lunched together, and Nebe often came
to me from such luncheons so completely exhausted that he had a
nervous breakdown. On two occasions Nebe had to be sent on long
sick leave because he simply could not stand the open cynicism
with which mass murder, and the technique of mass murder, were
discussed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remind you only of the gruesome chapter of the installation
of the first gas chambers, which was discussed in detail in this
circle, as were the experiments as to how one could remove the
Jews most quickly and most thoroughly. These were the most
horrible descriptions I have ever heard in my life. It is, of course,
so much worse when you hear them first-hand from someone who
is still under the direct impression of such discussions—and who
because of this is almost at the point of physical and mental collapse,
than when you hear of them now from documents. Nebe became
so ill that actually as early as 20 July he suffered from a persecution
mania and was a mere human wreck after everything he had
gone through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Was it the custom to have daily
dinner conferences of the chiefs of the Main Security Office, those
who happened to be in town?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Daily conferences; everything was discussed at
luncheon. This was of particular importance to us, because we
heard details of the methods used by the Gestapo in the fight
against our group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prove what I say, I can state here that, for instance, the
order issued for the arrest of Goerdeler on 17 July was decided
upon during such a luncheon conference, and Nebe warned us at
once. That is the reason why Goerdeler was able to escape, at least
for some time, and why we were able to know to what extent the
Gestapo were aware of our plot.
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And who were the regular attendants
at those luncheon conferences?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Kaltenbrunner presided. Then there were Gestapo
Müller, Schellenberg, Ohlendorf, and Nebe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And do you know whether, at those
meetings, the new kinds of torture and the technique of killing by
gas, and other measures in the concentration camps, were discussed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. That was discussed in great detail, and sometimes
I received the description only a few minutes later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, what is the situation with
reference to the information of the Foreign Office about the conduct
of the Gestapo? Will you tell us what was done to inform the
Foreign Office from time to time of the crimes that the Gestapo
were committing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The Foreign Office, particularly during the earlier
years, was continually kept informed, as nearly every day some
foreigner was half beaten to death or robbed, and then the diplomatic
missions would come with their complaints, and these
complaints were sent to the Ministry of the Interior by the Foreign
Office. These went through my office and sometimes I had four
or five such notes a day from the Foreign Office regarding excesses
by the Gestapo; and I can testify that in the course of years there
were no crimes by the Gestapo which were not set forth in these
notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you make certain reports to the
Foreign Office which were so dispatched that you are reasonably
certain they would reach Neurath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Ribbentrop was not yet the Foreign Minister at
that time...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: No, Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I very often discussed these matters personally with
the officials of the Foreign Office, because they were of a particularly
difficult nature, and because the officials of the Foreign Office
were very indignant, I asked them repeatedly to put these matters
before the Minister through the official channels. In addition, I
gave as much material as I could to one of the closest collaborators
of the Foreign Minister at that time, the Chief of Protocol, “Minister”
Von Bülow-Schwante; and according to the information I received
from Bülow-Schwante, he very often submitted that material to
Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, were certain of the collaborators
close collaborators of Von Papen? Was Von Papen subject to
action by the Gestapo?
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: To start with, the entire group around Von Papen
was continuously under surveillance by the Gestapo because in the
earlier years there was an impression among great masses of people
that Von Papen was a special advocate for decency and right.
A large group collected around Von Papen and that, of course, was
most carefully watched by the Gestapo. As the complaints, which
Von Papen received by the score, were carefully compiled in his
office, and as no doubt Von Papen quite often took these papers
either to Göring or to the Hindenburg palace, the closest collaborators
of Von Papen were especially suspected by the Gestapo. So it
was that on 30 June 1934 Oberregierungsrat Von Bose, the closest
collaborator of Von Papen, was shot dead in the doorway of Von
Papen’s office. The two other colleagues of Von Papen were imprisoned,
and the man who wrote Von Papen’s radio speeches,
Edgar Jung, was arrested weeks before the 30th of June; and on
the morning of 1 July, he was found murdered in a ditch along the
highway near Oranienburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did Von Papen continue in office
after that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I have never heard that he resigned; and I know
that very soon after the Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss was murdered,
he was sent to Vienna as Hitler’s ambassador.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did he ever make any protests that
you know of?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I personally heard of none at the time, although, we
were naturally extremely eager to hear which minister would
protest. However, no letter from Papen arrived at the Ministry
of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Were some of his collaborators
murdered after the Anschluss in Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: On the day of the Anschluss, when the SS entered
Austria, Von Papen’s closest collaborator, Legation Counsellor
Freiherr von Ketteler, was kidnapped by the Gestapo. We searched
for him for weeks, until 3 or 4 weeks later his body was washed
up on the banks of the Danube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: After that did Papen continue to
serve as a part of the Hitler Government and accept further offices
from Hitler’s hands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: He was no longer a member of the Government at
the time. Immediately after the march into Austria Von Papen was
disposed of by being made envoy. However, it was not long before
he continued his activities as Ambassador at Ankara.
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Does the Tribunal desire to rise at
this point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You would like a little more time, wouldn’t
you, with this witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: It will take a little more time, Your
Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 26 April 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<div><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH DAY</span><br/> Friday, 26 April 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May it please the Tribunal:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Gisevius, yesterday you made some reference to Herbert
Göring in saying that Schacht had sent word to you about the
Gestapo microphones in Schacht’s house. Will you tell us who
Herbert Göring was in relation to the defendant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Herbert Göring was a cousin of the Defendant
Göring. I had known him for many years. Herbert, as well as his
brothers and sisters, warned me already years ago about the
disaster which would overtake Germany if at any time a man like
their cousin Hermann Göring should get a position of even the
smallest responsibility. They acquainted me with the many characteristics
of the defendant which all of us had come to know in the
meantime, starting with his vanity, and continuing with his love of
ostentation, his lack of responsibility, his lack of scruples, even to
the extent of walking over the dead. In this way I already had
some idea what to expect of the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, during the period when you
were making these investigations and having these early conversations
with Schacht, and up until about 1937, you, as I understand
it, were very critical of Schacht because he had helped the Nazis
to power and continued to support them. Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I did not understand how an intelligent man, and
one who was as capable in economics as he was, could enter into
such a close relationship with Hitler. I was all the more bewildered
because, on the other hand, this man Schacht, from the very first
day and in a thousand small ways resisted the Nazis, and the
German public took pleasure in many sharp and humorous remarks
which he made about the Nazis. Great was my bewilderment, until
I actually met the man Schacht. And then...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: During this period Schacht did have
great influence with the German people, did he not, particularly
with German people of responsibility and power?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: He had great influence to the extent that many
Germans hoped to find a proponent of decency and justice in him,
since they heard that he undertook many steps in that direction. I
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
remember his activity in the Ministry of Economics, where officials
who were not Party members...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think we have covered that, and I
am anxious to get along with this, if I may interrupt you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: During this period you reported to
Dr. Schacht fully concerning your findings about the criminal activities
of the Gestapo, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes; from time to time I spoke more frankly, and
it is obvious that I...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And he took the position, as I understand
you, that Hitler and Göring did not know about these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. He was of the opinion that Hitler did not know
anything about such terrible things, and that Göring knew at most
only a part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And he stood by Göring until 1937,
when Göring pushed him out of the economics office, did he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe that was at the end of 1936. I may be
wrong. I believe it would be more correct to say that he looked for
support from Göring and hoped that Göring would protect him
from the Party and the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, Schacht did not heed
warnings about Göring until late 1936 or 1937?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And during this period there would
be no doubt, would there, that Schacht was the dominant economic
figure in the rearmament program until he was superseded by
Göring with the Four Year Plan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I do not know whether everything went through like
that exactly. He was, of course, as Minister of Economics, the
leading man in German economy, not only for rearmament but for
all questions of German economy; rearmament was just one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now Schacht believed, and as I understand
it, you too believed during all this period that under German
constitutional law no war could be declared except by authority of
the Reich Cabinet. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, from the point of view
of the German Constitution, the war was illegal, by German law,
as declared and carried out by Hitler, in your view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: According to our firm conviction, yes.
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think we found out yesterday the
position you were to have if there was a successful overthrow of the
Hitler regime. Schacht was under consideration for Chancellor, was
he not, if that movement was successful?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No. It is only correct as to the first offer that Halder
made in August of 1938, or perhaps July 1938, when he visited
Schacht for the first time. At that time, according to the information
which I received, Halder asked Schacht whether, in the case of an
overthrow, he would be ready to take over a position like that.
Schacht replied that he would be ready for anything if the generals
would eliminate the Nazi regime and Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as the year 1939 individual opponents formed a group,
and at the last, when Beck was the acknowledged head of all conspirators
from the left to the right wing, Goerdeler emerged in the
foreground together with Beck as the leading candidate for the
position of Reich Chancellor, so that after that time we need speak
only of Goerdeler in that regard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I want to ask you some questions
about the Defendant Keitel. Of course, we have heard that Hitler
was the actual head of the state, but I want to ask you whether
Keitel occupied a position of real leadership and power in the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Keitel occupied one of the most influential positions
in the Third Reich. I would like to say at this point that I was a
very close friend of four of the closest collaborators of Keitel. One
was the Chief of the Ordnance Office in the OKW, the murdered
General Olbricht; the second was the Chief of the Counterintelligence
Service, Admiral Canaris, who was also murdered; the third was the
Chief of the Army Legal Department, Ministerial Director Sack—he
was also murdered—and finally there was the chief of the armament
economy department, General Thomas, who escaped being murdered
as though by a miracle. A close friendship, I might say, bound me
to these men, and thus from these men I found out exactly what
tremendous influence Keitel had over the OKW and in all Army
matters, and thereby what influence he wielded in representing the
Army in the eyes of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be that Keitel did not influence Hitler to a great extent.
But I must testify here to the fact that Keitel influenced the OKW
and the Army all the more. Keitel decided which documents were
to be transmitted to Hitler. It was not possible for Admiral Canaris
or one of the other gentlemen I mentioned to submit an urgent
report to Hitler of his own accord. Keitel took it over, and what he
did not like he did not transmit, or he gave these men the official
order to abstain from making such a report. Also, Keitel repeatedly
threatened these men, telling them that they were to limit themselves
exclusively to their own specialized sectors, and that he would
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
not protect them with respect to any political utterance which was
critical of the Party and the Gestapo, of the persecution of the Jews,
the murders in Russia, or the anti-Church campaign, and, as he said
later, he would not hesitate to dismiss these gentlemen from the
Wehrmacht and turn them over to the Gestapo. I have read the
notes in regard to this which Admiral Canaris made in his diary.
I have read the notes of General Oster in regard to this from the
conferences of commanders in the OKW. I have talked with the
Chief Judge of the Army, Dr. Sack, about this, and it is my strong
wish to testify here that Field Marshal Keitel, who should have
protected his officers, repeatedly threatened them with the Gestapo.
He put these men under pressure, and these gentlemen considered
that a special insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, whether Keitel could
control Hitler or not, he did have a very large control of the entire
OKW underneath him. Is that not true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Did you say Hitler? No, Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Whether Keitel could control Hitler or
not he did control and command the entire OKW underneath him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, whatever Hitler’s own
inclinations may have been, these men in this dock formed a ring
around him which kept out information from your group as to what
was going on unless they wanted Hitler to hear it, isn’t that a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. I believe that I should cite two more examples
which I consider especially significant. First of all, every means was
tried to persuade Keitel to warn Hitler, before the invasion of Belgium
and Holland, and to tell him, that is Hitler, that the information
which had been submitted by Keitel regarding the alleged
violation of neutrality by the Dutch and Belgians was wrong. The
counterintelligence was to produce these reports which would incriminate
the Dutch and Belgians. Admiral Canaris at that time
refused to sign these reports. I ask that this be verified. He told
Keitel repeatedly that these reports, which were supposedly produced
by the OKW, were wrong. That is one example when Keitel did
not transmit to Hitler what he should have transmitted. The second
was that Keitel was asked by Canaris and Thomas to submit to
Hitler the details of the murders in Poland and Russia. Admiral
Canaris and his friends were anxious to prevent even the beginning
of these mass murders and to inform Keitel while the first preparations
by the Gestapo were being made for these infamous actions.
We received the documents, through Nebe and others. Keitel was
informed as to this in detail, and here again he did not resist at the
beginning; and he who did not stop the Gestapo at the beginning
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
can not be surprised if in the end a millionfold injustice was the
upshot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, I think you put your
question, “Did not these men in the dock form a ring which prevented
you getting to Hitler,” and the question was answered rather as
though it applied only to Keitel. If you intended to put it with
reference to all defendants, I think it ought to be cleared up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think that is true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Each of the defendants who held
ministerial positions of any kind controlled the reports which should
go to Hitler from that particular ministry, did he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As far as this general question is concerned, I must
reply cautiously, for, first of all, it was a close clan which put a
cordon of silence around Hitler. A man like Von Papen or Von
Neurath cannot be included in this group, for it was obvious that
Von Papen and Von Neurath, and perhaps one or the other of the
defendants, did not have the possibility, or much later no longer had
the possibility, of having regular access to Hitler, for besides Von
Neurath, Hitler already had his Ribbentrop for a long time. Thus
I can only say that a certain group, which is surely well known,
composed the close circle of which I am speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I should like you to identify those of
the defendants who had access to Hitler and those who were able to
prevent access to Hitler by their subordinates. That would apply,
would it not, to Göring, Ribbentrop, Keitel, Kaltenbrunner, Frick,
and to Schacht—during the period until he broke with them, as you
have testified—and to Dönitz, Raeder, Sauckel, and Speer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: You mentioned a few too many and some are
missing. Take the Defendant Jodl, for instance. I would like to call
your attention to the strange influence which this defendant had
and the position he had with regard to controlling access to Hitler.
I believe my testimony shows that Schacht, on the other hand, did
not control access to Hitler, but that he could only be glad about
each open and decent report which got through to Hitler from his
and other ministries. As far as the defendant Frick is concerned, I
do not believe that he was necessarily in a position to control access
to Hitler. I believe the problem of Frick centers in the matter of
responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Should I have included Funk in the
group that had access to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Funk, without a doubt, had access to Hitler for a
long time, and for his part Funk had of course the responsibility to
see that affairs in the Ministry of Economics and in the Reichsbank
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
were conducted in the way Hitler desired. Without a doubt Funk
put his surpassingly expert knowledge at the service of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you prepare or participate in
preparing reports which were sent to Keitel as to the criminal
activities of the Gestapo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did others participate with you in the
preparation of those reports?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, it was the work of a group. We gathered reports
about plans and preparations of the Gestapo, and we gathered
material about the first infamous acts, so that some courageous men
at the front, officers of the General Staff and of the Army, went to
the scene, prepared reports, made photographs, and this material
came then to both Canaris and Oster. Then the problem arose: how
can we bring this material to Keitel? It was generally known that
officers, even highly placed officers like Canaris and Thomas, were
forbidden to report on political matters. The difficulty was, therefore,
not to have Canaris and the others come under the suspicion
that they were dealing with politics; we employed the roundabout
method of preparing so-called counterintelligence agents’ reports
from foreign countries or from occupied countries; and with the
pretext that different agents from all countries were here reporting
about these outrages, or that agents traveling through or in foreign
countries had found such infamous photographs we then submitted
these reports to Field Marshal Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, did Canaris and Oster participate
in submitting those reports to Keitel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. Without Canaris and Oster the working out and
the gathering of this material would have been inconceivable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And what positions did Canaris and
Oster hold with reference to Keitel at this time when these reports
were being submitted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Canaris was the senior officer of the OKW. Formally
he even had to represent Keitel when Keitel was absent. Keitel was
only concerned that someone else should take his place at such
times, usually his Party general, Reinecke; and Oster, as the
representative, Chief of Staff for Canaris, was also in close association
with Canaris. Keitel could not have wished for closer contact
with reality and truth than through this connection with the Chief
of his Wehrmacht Counterintelligence Service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: So these reports which were sent to
Keitel came from the highest men in his own organization under
himself?
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, what did they report to Keitel?
Let me ask you if they reported to him that there was a systematic
program of murder of the insane going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed. On these subjects, too, records were
completed in detail including the despairing reports of the directors
of the lunatic asylums. I recall this exactly because here, too, we
had great difficulties in giving a reason for these reports, and we
actually put them through as reports of foreign doctors who had
heard of these things with indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did he report to him the persecution
and murder of the Jews and the program of extermination of the
Jews that was being carried out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: From the first Jewish pogroms in 1938 on Keitel was
minutely informed of each new action against the Jews, particularly
about the establishment of the first gas chamber, or rather, the
establishment of the first mass graves in the East, up to the erection
of the murder factories later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did these reports mention the atrocities
that were committed in Poland against the Poles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed, here I would say again that the atrocities
in Poland, too, started with isolated murders which were so
horrible that we were still able to report on single cases, and could
add the names of the responsible SS leaders. Here, too, Keitel was
spared nothing of the terrible truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And did that condition of informing
Keitel also prevail as to the atrocities against nationals in other
occupied countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. First of all I must of course mention the atrocities
in Russia, because I must emphasize that Keitel now certainly,
on the basis of the Polish atrocities, had been warned sufficiently as
to what was at hand in Russia. And I remember how the preparation
of these orders, such as the order for the shooting of commissars
and the Night and Fog Decree, was continued for weeks in
the OKW, so that, as soon as the preparation of these orders was
begun, we begged Canaris and Oster to present a petition to Keitel.
But I would like to add that I do not doubt that other courageous
men also presented a petition to Keitel in this connection. Since I
belonged to a certain group, the impression might be created that
only in this group were there persons who were interested in these
problems, and I would be withholding vital information if I did not
add that even in the High Command of the OKW and in the General
Staff there were excellent men who did everything to reach Keitel
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
through their separate channels, and that there were also brave
men in many ministries who tried to reach every officer whom they
saw in order to plead with him to order a stop to this injustice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did the reports to Keitel mention the
forced enslavement of millions of foreign workers and their deportation
or importation into Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And those enslaved laborers are the
displaced persons, largely, of this day—that are plaguing Germany
today, are they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed. In this connection I would also like to
say that in our reports it was already mentioned just what responsibility
the Wehrmacht would have to bear if these ill-treated people
should be free some day. We had an idea of what was to come, and
those who made the reports at that time can understand what has
now taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did the reports to Keitel report the
persecution of the churches in the occupied countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, they did. I would like to cite as a special
example how we even once sent leading churchmen to Norway in
the guise of agents. They established contact with Bishop Bergraf,
and brought back very detailed reports of what Bishop Bergraf
thought about the persecution of the churches in Norway and other
countries. I can still see this report before me because Keitel also
wrote one of his well-known National Socialist Party phrases on
this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, these reports consisted both of
information furnished by Canaris and Oster and of the reports
coming in from the field under this plan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I want to ask you a few questions
about the SA and the SS organizations. In your book, which you
have been asked about, I think you have characterized the SA as a
private army of the Nazi organization. Is that a correct characterization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: During the early part of the struggle
for power the SA constituted a private army for carrying out the
orders of the Nazi Party, did it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: They took in a good many people in
the SA, and it got pretty large, and there came a time when there
was some danger it would get away from them; wasn’t there?
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the murder of Röhm and his
associates was a struggle for power, was it not, between Göring and
Himmler and the Nazi crowd associated with them on one hand and
Röhm and his associates on the other?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: After the murder of Röhm, this SA
organization, which was very big at the time, rather lost importance,
didn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the SS, which was a smaller and
more compact organization, came in to take its place as a private
army, didn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, as the decisive private army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, let’s go back to the SA during
the period before the struggle for power resulting in the Röhm
purge. What part did the SA play in the battle for power, the
seizure of power?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As is said in the song, “It cleared the streets for the
Brown Battalions,” and without a doubt the SA played a dominant
role in the so-called seizure of power. Without the SA Hitler would
undoubtedly never have come to power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, let’s take up their methods.
Perhaps I can shorten this by quoting from your book. I think you
say that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Whoever had not entirely made up his mind, had it made up
for him unequivocally by the SA. Their methods were primitive,
therefore all the more effective. For instance, one learned
the new Hitler salute very quickly when, on the sidewalks,
beside every marching SA column—and where were there no
parades in those days—a few stalwart SA men went along
giving pedestrians a crack on the head right and left if they
failed to perform the correct gesture at least three steps
ahead of the SA flag. And these Storm Troopers acted the
same way in all things.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that a correct account of their activities and influence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I hope so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you know so, don’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, yes, of course, for it is my own description, I
cannot criticize it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, but you saw these things yourself,
did you not? You were in Germany at that time?
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You see, it is very difficult for us,
with all the documents we have, Doctor, to get the picture of the
day to day events, and you were there and we were not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, let me make another question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The chronicle of that private army is colorful and stirring.
It teemed with beer hall brawls, street fights, knifings, shootings,
and fist fights, altogether a mad rough and tumble
affair, where naturally there was no question of crises of
leadership or of mutinies. In this brotherhood of the wild
men of German nationalism there was undoubtedly much
idealism, but at the same time the SA was the repository for
political derelicts. The failures of all classes found refuge
there. The discontents, the disinherited, the desperados
streamed to it wholesale. The core, the paid permanent group,
and particularly the leaders, were recruited, as time went on,
more and more from the riffraff of a period of political and
social decay.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that a correct statement of your observations of the SA at that
time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, quite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May I call your attention to another
question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The SA organized huge raids. The SA searched houses.
The SA confiscated property. The SA cross-examined people.
The SA put people in jail. In short, the SA appointed themselves
permanent auxiliary police and paid no attention to
any of the principles of the so-called system period (Weimar
Republic). The worst problem for the helpless authorities was
that the SA never returned its booty at all. Woe unto anyone
who gets into their clutches!</p>

<p>“From this time dated the ‘Bunker,’ those dreaded private
prisons of which every SA Storm Troop had to have at least
one. ‘Taking away’ became the right of the SA. The efficiency
of a Standartenführer was measured by the number
of arrests he had made, and the good reputation of an SA
man was based on the effectiveness with which he ‘educated’ ”—in
quotation marks, the quotation marks being
yours—“ ‘educated’ his prisoners. Brawls could no longer be
staged in the fight for power, yet the ‘fight’ went on, only
the blows were now struck in the full enjoyment of power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that a correct statement of your observations of the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think you also used the term
“Bunker,” and it is a slightly technical term with which some of us
are not familiar. Will you tell the Tribunal what this Bunker
system of the SA was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Bunkers were those cellars or other dungeons with
thick walls in which the poor prisoners were locked up, where they
were then beaten and in a large measure beaten to death. They
were these private jails in which, during the first months, the
leaders of the leftist parties and of the trade unions were systematically
rendered harmless, which explains the phenomenon that the
leftist groups did not act again for so long a time, for there, at the
outset and most thoroughly, the entire leadership was done away
with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You also use the expression “ ‘taking
away’ became the inalienable right of the SA,” and “taking away”
is in quotation marks. Will you tell us about this “taking away,”
what it means?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was the arbitrary arrest, whereby the relatives
often for periods of weeks or months did not know where the poor
victims had disappeared to, and could be glad if they ever returned
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think you also make this observation
in your book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Every excess, pardoned as ‘overzealousness in the cause of
the National Socialist Revolution,’ was a demonstration of
official sanction and necessarily drew in its wake a new
excess. It was the bestiality tolerated during the first months
that later encouraged the sadistic murderers in the concentration
camps. The growth in brutality and insensibility of
the general public, which toward the end of the revolution
extended far beyond the domain of the Gestapo, was the unavoidable
consequence of this first irresponsible attempt to
give free rein to the Brown Shirts for their acts of violence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Does that, too, represent your observation of the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes—not of the SA alone but also of general conditions
in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, will you tell us about—as I
understand you, after the Röhm Purge the SA was rather abandoned
as the private army, and a more reliable and smaller and
more compact private army was created under Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: A guard which had been established by Himmler
long before this time now actually came into action. I do not doubt
that Himmler and his closest circle for years had worked toward
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
this very objective so that one day, with their Schutztruppe (protective
guard), they could establish the terror system in Germany.
But until 30 June the SS had been a part of the SA, and Göring—excuse
me, Röhm was also the chief of the SS. The road for
Himmler to police chief in Germany, to police chief of evil, was
only open after Röhm had been eliminated with his much larger
SA. But the will to power of the SS and all the confused and
unscrupulous ideas connected therewith must be assumed to have
existed in the leadership of the SS already for many years previous
to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, this SS organization selected its
members with great care, did it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Will you tell us something about the
qualifications for membership? What was necessary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The members had to be so-called Nordic types.
Actually I always considered these questionnaires as a good subject
for a humorous paper, and for that reason I am not in a position
today to give you exact particulars, except that, if I am not
mistaken, the distinguishing characteristics of men and women went
so far as underarm perspiration. I recall that Heydrich and
Himmler, in selecting SS men who were to do police duty, decided
only after a picture had been submitted to them of the future
victim who would be charged with carrying out their evil commands.
I know that, for example, Nebe repeatedly saved officials
in the criminal police force (Kripo) from being transferred to the
ranks of the Gestapo by having poor photographs taken of these
people so that, as far as possible, they did not look Nordic. In that
case, of course, they were turned down immediately. But it would
be going too far afield to relate more about these dismal things in
this courtroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, was the membership of the SS
recruited only from what we may call fanatical Nazis, reliable
Nazis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe we have to make a distinction. In the first
years of the SS, many decent German people, especially farmers
and people in the country, felt drawn to the SS, because they
believed Himmler’s assurance that the SS was to bring order to
Germany and to be a counterbalance to the SA terror. In that way,
to my knowledge, some people in the years before 1933, and even
in 1933 and 1934, entered the SS, because they hoped that here
would be a nucleus standing for order and right, and I believe it
is my duty to point out the tragedy of these people. Each and
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
every case should be examined before deciding whether, later on,
a member was guilty or whether he remained decent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from a certain period of time on—I believe I specified
yesterday 1935—no one could have any doubts as to the real SS
objectives. From then on—here I would like to take up your own
expression—fanatical National Socialists, that is, “super” National
Socialists, entered the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And from 1935 on, was it, in your
judgment as one who was on the ground, necessarily so, that the
persons who entered it knew what its actual activities were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes; what he was entering into and what orders
he had to expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The Tribunal wishes me to ask you
in reference to yesterday’s incident if you have anything to add.
I know nothing further on that incident, in reference to the threat
made. Is there anything that you wish to add about that incident
in order to make it clear to the Tribunal, anything that has not
been told about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I would like to make clear that Dr. Dix did not
merely inform me about a discussion he had with Dr. Stahmer.
That morning I arrived in the room of the attorneys, and I do not
wish to state further particulars, but the atmosphere there was not
exactly cordial to begin with. Then I went up to Dr. Dix to report
something else. Dr. Stahmer approached, obviously very excited,
and asked Dr. Dix for an immediate interview. Dr. Dix refused on
the ground that he was talking to me. Dr. Stahmer said in a loud
voice that he must speak to Dr. Dix immediately and urgently.
Dr. Dix took only two steps aside and the conversation that followed
was carried on by Dr. Stahmer in such a loud voice, that I
was bound to hear most of it. I did hear it and said to attorney
Dr. Kraus who was standing nearby, “Just listen how Dr. Stahmer
is carrying on.” Dr. Dix then came over to me, very excited, and
after all this fuss, in response to my questions as to what precisely
was the demand of the Defendant Göring, he told me what I had
half heard anyway. I would like to underline that if I had had the
opportunity to tell the story first in my own way, I would have
emphasized that I was under the impression that Dr. Stahmer had
merely transmitted a statement, or rather what I would call a
threat, by the Defendant Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, in this Nazi regime, after Hitler
came to power, will you state whether there was, as far as you
could see, a systematic practice of the Nazi ministers and Nazi
officials enriching themselves by reasons of their confiscation of
property of Jews and others?
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. This became more cynical from year to year
and we kept lists as to which of the civil ministers and, above all,
which of the generals and field marshals participated in this system.
We planned to inquire of all the generals and ministers at a later
date whether these donations had been put into a bank account or
whether they had possibly used this money for their own personal
interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And will you state to the Tribunal
which of the defendants were engaged in self-enrichment in the
manner that you have indicated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I am sorry I am only able to give a negative reply
since we repeatedly inquired from the Defendant Schacht...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps this will be a good time to adjourn
for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Dr. Gisevius, I have just a few more
questions which I would like to put to you in reference to the war
and the resistance movement of which you were a part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Justice Jackson, there is just one question
I should like to ask the witness. You said that you kept lists
of the ministers and generals who participated in this system of
spoils. What was your source of information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We had information from the various ministries,
from antechambers of ministries, and from the Finance Ministry.
But I did not finish the answer before. I said that I could answer
the question as to which of the defendants had enriched himself
only in the negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the Defendant Schacht, I wanted to continue saying
that I personally did not look into these lists, and that I took part
only in the questioning of the Defendant Schacht and that he personally
had not enriched himself. I did not intend to say in any
sense, therefore, that all the defendants, especially Defendants
Von Papen or Von Neurath, to name only these two, had enriched
themselves. I do not know. I wanted to say only that about Schacht
we know, or rather I know, that he did not take part in that
system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, in addition to a system of spoils
from confiscated property, there were also open gifts from Hitler to
the generals and ministers, were there not, of large sums of property
and money?
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes. These were the famous donations with which,
especially in the years after the outbreak of the war, the top
generals were systematically corrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And did that hold true with reference
to many of the ministers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I do not doubt it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, as I understood your testimony,
whatever doubts you may have had before 1938 when the affair
Fritsch occurred, that event or series of events convinced even
Schacht that Hitler was bent on aggressive warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: After the Fritsch crisis Schacht was convinced that
now radicalism and the course toward war could no longer be
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There was never any doubt in the
minds of all of you men who were in the resistance movement,
was there, that the attack on Poland of September 1939 was aggression
on Hitler’s part?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, no, there could be no doubt about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that diplomatic means of righting
whatever wrongs Germany felt she suffered in reference to the
Corridor and Danzig had not been exhausted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I can only point to the existing documents. There
was no will for peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, in the German resistance movement,
as I understand you, there was agreement that you wanted
to obtain various modifications of the Treaty of Versailles, and you
also wanted various economic betterments for Germany, just as
other people wanted them. That was always agreed upon, was
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We were all agreed that a calm and a reasonable
balance could be achieved again in Europe only when certain modifications
of the Versailles Treaty were carried through by means of
peaceful negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your difference from the Nazi group
was chiefly, in reference to that matter, one of method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: From the very beginning, as I understand
you, it was the position of your group that a war would
result disastrously for Germany as well as for the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that the necessary modifications,
given a little patience, could be brought about by peaceful means.
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Absolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, it was in the light of that difference
of opinion, I suppose, that your resistance movement against
the regime in power in Germany carried out these proposals for
Putsche and assassinations which you have described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, but I would like to add that we were not only
thinking of the great dangers outside, but we also realized what
dangers lay in such a system of terror. From the very beginning
there was a group of people in Germany who still did not even
think of the possibility of war, and nevertheless protested against
injustice, the deprivation of liberty, and the fight against religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beginning, therefore, it was not a fight against war, but
if I may say so, it was a fight for human rights. From the very
first moment on, among all classes of people, in all professional
circles, and in all age groups, there were people who were ready to
fight, to suffer, and to die for that idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the question may arise here as
to what your motives and what your purposes in this resistance
movement were with reference to the German people, and I shall
ask you to state to the Tribunal your overall purpose in resisting
the Government in power in your country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should like to say that death has reaped such a
rich harvest among the members of the resistance movement, that
it is only for that reason I can sit here, and that otherwise more
worthy and able men could give this answer. Having said this, I
feel that I can answer that, whether Jew or Christian, there were
people in Germany who believed in the freedom of religion, in
justice, and human dignity, not only for Germany but also, in their
profound responsibility as Germans, for the higher concept of
Europe and the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There was a group which composed
this resistance, as I understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It was not only just a group, but many individuals
had to carry the secret of their resistance silently to their death
rather than confide it to the Gestapo records; and only a very few
persons have enjoyed the distinction of being referred to now as a
group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Most of the men who were associated
with you in this movement are dead?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Almost all of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is there anything you would like to
add to clarify your position to the Tribunal, Dr. Gisevius?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Excuse me, I did not understand you.
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Is there anything you would like to
add in order that the Tribunal may understand your position in
this, your feeling, your very strong feeling in this matter, to understand
and appraise your own relation to this situation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I do not like to talk of myself, but I want to thank
you, Mr. Prosecutor, for giving me an opportunity to testify
emphatically on behalf of the dead and the living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I have concluded the examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MAJOR GENERAL G. A. ALEXANDROV (Assistant Prosecutor
for the U.S.S.R.): Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was not the understanding arrived at with
Counsel for the Prosecution that the witness for the Defendant
Frick should only be cross-examined by one prosecutor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Mr. President, I have an agreement with
the prosecutors to the effect that the examination of the Defendant
Schacht and his witnesses will be carried out by the American
Prosecution, but that, in the presence of additional questions during
cross-examination, the prosecutor from the Soviet Prosecution could
also join in the examination. In view of the fact that the Soviet
Prosecution has several additional questions to ask the witness
Gisevius, which are of great importance to the case, I ask permission
to address these questions to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What are the questions which you say are of
particular importance to the Soviet Union? I do not mean the individual
questions but the general nature of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Questions in connection with the part
played by the Defendant Frick in the preparation for war, questions
connected with the attitude of the Defendant Schacht towards the
Hitler regime, as well as a number of other important questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn in order to consider
whether the Prosecution ought to be allowed to cross-examine
this witness in addition to the cross-examination which has already
taken place.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has before it two documents
which were presented to it by the Chief Prosecutors upon the subject
of cross-examination. In the first of these documents it was
provided that the following procedure for the cross-examination
of the Defendants Keitel, Kaltenbrunner, Frank, Frick, Streicher,
and Funk was agreed; and that with reference to Frick the
American Prosecution was to conduct the cross-examination of the
defendant and his witness. The document was presented because
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
of the Tribunal’s express desire that too much time should not be
taken up by the cross-examination by more than one prosecutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to that document there was another document, which
was only a tentative agreement, and with reference to the Defendant
Schacht it provided that the American delegation should conduct
the principal cross-examination and the Soviet and the French
delegations should consider whether either would wish to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of those two documents, the first of which suggests that
the Prosecution have agreed to only one cross-examination of the
witnesses of the Defendant Frick, and the second of which tentatively
suggests that, in addition to the American Prosecution, the
Soviet and the French might wish to cross-examine, the Tribunal
propose to allow the additional cross-examination in the present
instance, and they are loath to lay down any hard and fast rule
concerning cross-examination. They hope, however, that in the
present instance, after the full cross-examination by the Prosecutor
of the United States, the Soviet Prosecutor will make his cross-examination
as short as possible. For the future, the Tribunal
hopes that the prosecutors may be able to agree among themselves
that in the case of witnesses one cross-examination only will be
sufficient, and that in any event the additional cross-examination
will be made as brief as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Witness, in order to save time, I beg you
to answer my questions as briefly as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tell me, what part did the German Ministry of the Interior and
the Defendant Frick personally play in the preparation for the
second World War?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: This question is very difficult for me to answer. I
left the Ministry of the Interior as early as May 1935, and I actually
cannot say any more about conditions after that time than any
other German, that is, that the Ministry of the Interior was part of
the German government machine and doubtlessly there, as in all
other ministries, those preparations for war were made which
administrations have to make in such cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: May I say something? The witness has
just stated that he could not say any more in answering that question
than any other German could. I believe that, under these
circumstances, the witness is not the right person to make any
factual statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He has just said so himself. That is exactly
what he said. I don’t see any reason for any intervention. The
witness said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I only meant that he could not even
function as a witness concerning these facts.
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: For perfectly obvious reasons I am deprived
of all possibility to put these questions to any German, but
I am perfectly satisfied with the answers of the witness Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Do you know anything about the so-called
“Three Man College”? It consisted of the Plenipotentiary
for the Administration of the Reich, of the Plenipotentiary for
Economy, and of a representative of the OKW. This Three Man
College was entrusted with the preparation of all fundamental
questions pertaining to the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I personally cannot give any information on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Do you know anything about the activities
of the Ministry of the Interior in territories occupied by the
Germans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As far as I know, the Ministry of the Interior sent
important officials into the military administration, but it is not
clear to me whether these officials, from that moment on, were
subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior or the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Have you any special knowledge as to
whether the machinery of the Reich Commission in the occupied
territories of the Soviet Union was recruited from the Ministry of
the Interior or at least with considerable help from this ministry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should assume so, yes. It holds good as far as help
is concerned, because the ministry for the occupied Russian territories
could take its officials only from the personnel department
of the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: What do you know of the visits paid by
the Defendant Frick to the concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At the time when I was in the Ministry of the
Interior I did not hear anything about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: And after that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: After that I did not hear anything about it either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Could a situation arise in which the Defendant
Frick, although Minister of the Interior, would not be
informed regarding the system of concentration camps established
in Germany and of the violence and lawlessness practiced in the
camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe that I have already yesterday given exhaustive
information as to the fact that we were informed about
everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: In this particular case I am interested
in the Defendant Frick. What do you know about him in this
connection?
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I have said yesterday that the Reich Ministry of the
Interior received numberless calls for help from all over the
country, and yesterday we even saw a letter from the Ministry of
Justice. Also I have referred...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This subject was fully covered yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I shall pass on to the next question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Are you acquainted with the secret law
issued in Germany in 1940 concerning the killing of sick persons
and the old?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: What was the attitude of the Defendant
Frick towards the promulgation and enforcing of this law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I assume that he, as Minister of the Interior, signed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The law, if there was a law, was after 1935,
was it not? What is the law that you are putting? If it was in
1935, then this witness was not in the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I am speaking of the law which was
promulgated in 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He would not know anything about it any
more than anybody else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I am satisfied with the answer which I
have received from the witness. Will you now allow me to proceed
to questions concerning the Defendant Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, you were in close relations
with the Defendant Schacht for a considerable period of time; have
I understood you correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Thus you were sufficiently acquainted
with the state and political activities of the Defendant Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe so, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Tell me, what do you know about the
part played by the Defendant Schacht in Hitler’s seizure of power?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That was just the time when I did not yet know
Schacht, and about which I cannot give any information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: What do you know about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I knew only that he entered the Cabinet and that
without doubt he assisted Hitler in the preliminary political negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Do you know anything about the meeting
engineered by Schacht between Hitler and the big industrialists, in
February 1933?
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: As a result of this meeting a fund was
created by the industrialists with a view to guaranteeing the success
of the Nazi Party at the elections. What do you know about this
meeting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I know nothing about this meeting. In my book I
wrote that to my knowledge the largest amount for the election
campaign in 1932 was given by Thyssen at that time and Grauert, a
member of the Rhein-Hessian iron and steel industry group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: What was the part played by the Defendant
Schacht on this occasion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At that time I did not see Schacht in the Ruhr
district, and I also do not know whether he was there at that time.
I emphasize again that I did not know him at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I know that. But in your book entitled
<span class='it'>Until the Bitter End</span>, published in 1946, and in your replies to preliminary
interrogations by defendant’s counsel Dix, you favorably
described the Defendant Schacht; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I did not understand the last words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I repeat that you favorably described the
Defendant Schacht; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: You state that as from 1936, the Defendant
Schacht was in opposition to Hitlerite regime, and that he expressed
these opinions in a fairly open manner; is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I state expressly that beginning with 1936 his
suspicions were aroused, but that he only became an opponent of
Hitler during the Fritsch crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: In which year do you place this crisis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: End of 1937 and beginning of 1938. The Fritsch
crisis was at the beginning of 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Tell us, under the then existing regime
in Germany, could a situation arise where Hitler would not be
informed as to these opposite views of Schacht which, according to
you, existed at the end of 1937?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: You mean that Hitler was not informed after 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: No. I asked you, could it be possible,
under the then existing regime in Germany, that Hitler was not
informed as to this antagonistic attitude on the part of Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Hitler knew very well that Schacht was very critical
towards the system and that he frequently expressed disapproval.
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
He often received letters from Schacht and of course heard a great
deal, too. But he did not know how far that opposition went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Then how could Schacht remain in the
Government of the Reich, as Minister without Portfolio and personal
adviser to Hitler, right up to January 1943, if Hitler, as you say,
was fully aware of his critical attitude towards his, Hitler’s, policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Hitler always took care to let prominent individuals
disappear quietly or put them in the shade so that foreign propaganda
could not take advantage of these facts. The Schacht case
is not the only one in which Hitler tried to camouflage an open
crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Were you acquainted with a letter from
Hitler of 19 January 1939, addressed to Schacht, who at that time
was being relieved of his post as President of the Reichsbank? I
should like to remind you of the contents of that letter in which
Hitler writes to Schacht as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I avail myself on the occasion of your release from the post
of President of the Board of Directors of the Reichsbank to
thank you most warmly, most sincerely for the services you
have repeatedly rendered while in that position, to Germany
and to me personally, during long and arduous years. Above
all else, your name will be connected forever with the first
period of national rearmament. I am happy that you will
now be able, as Reichsminister, to proceed to the solution
of new tasks...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This was all gone over yesterday by the
witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Please forgive me, but I have a question
to put to the witness in connection with this letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] It would appear, from the contents of
this letter, that in January 1939—and I stress the date, Witness—Hitler
expressed his appreciation of Schacht’s activities rather differently
from the manner in which you worded your evidence. How
do you reconcile this divergence of opinion with your assertion that
the Defendant Schacht was already in direct opposition to Hitler’s
regime towards the end of 1937 and the beginning of 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I should like to answer that I am not accustomed
to consider any written or oral proclamation by Hitler as truthful.
That man always said only that which seemed opportune to him at
the moment to deceive the world or Germany. In this particular
case Hitler intended to avoid the impression that Schacht’s resignation
would cause a difficult economic crisis. But I am only
saying now what Hitler could have had in his mind. Yesterday I
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
described with what indignation Schacht received that letter. He
considered it derision and debasement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Then I shall refer to another document,
to a letter from Schacht himself addressed to Hitler. This is a
memorandum of 7 January 1939, in which Schacht wrote to Hitler:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“From the very beginning the Reichsbank has realized that
the fruits of a successful foreign policy can only be obtained
if this policy is founded on the rebirth of the Wehrmacht. It
therefore took upon itself, to a very large extent, the financing
of the armament program, despite the monetary and
political difficulties involved. The justification of this consisted
in the necessity, which far outweighed all other arguments,
of manufacturing arms immediately, <span class='it'>ex nihilo</span>, often
even under disguise, in order to ensure a foreign policy which
would command respect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you also consider this document as an expression of Schacht’s
attitude?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As far as I have understood, you refer to a letter
from the year 1935, is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I refer to a letter of 7 January 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Please pardon me. Then I can say only what I said
yesterday: that all these letters were very carefully written so that
they could not be considered a provocation, and the factual contents
of the letter made illusory lest Hitler should simply say, “This is a
personal attack on me.” I said yesterday that the problem was to
convince the other conservative ministers, who were not so much
against Hitler, about the actual situation and neutralize any
opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: What was the attitude of the Defendant
Schacht towards the Anschluss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The Anschluss happened right in the middle of the
Fritsch crisis, or probably at the dramatic climax, and that is why
we were firmly convinced that this was a particularly malevolent
case of camouflage, and in that sense we were indignant. We had no
doubt that the German Army was to be diverted outwards...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, wait a minute. You were asked if
you knew what the attitude of Schacht was to the Anschluss question
at that time. You are not answering that question. Do you or do
you not know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I cannot give a definite answer about that, because
all of us saw clearly that the problem of Austria had to be solved in
a legal way. There were differences of opinion with regard to this
question in our group. Most of us hoped that the independence of
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
Austria could be preserved. Especially from the German point of
view, it was desirable that another independent German State
should exist, if at any later time there should be a League of Nations
or diplomatic negotiations. However, I cannot state under oath
whether Schacht personally was of that opinion or whether he was
for an outright annexation. He was certainly against the method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I shall quote an excerpt from a speech
made by Schacht in Vienna, in March 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Thank God, these matters could not, in the end, hinder the
forward march of the great German people, for Adolf Hitler
has created a community of German will and thought, he
supported it with the reborn strength of the Wehrmacht, and
thereby gave an outward form to this spiritual union of Germany
and Austria.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you qualify these statements of Schacht’s also as expressions
of his opposition to the Hitler regime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I would have to be able to read the speech in its
entirety. I personally would not have said it, but I do not know
whether pure judgment on my part here serves any purpose.
Would it not be better to ask Schacht what he meant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The speech can be put to Schacht when he
goes into the witness box, if he does.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Tell me, Witness, you are currently residing
in Switzerland? In which town?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I live near Geneva in a village called Commugny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: How long have you lived in Switzerland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Since the first of October 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Did you know about Schacht’s arrival in
Switzerland in 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No. He did not come to Switzerland in 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: In 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: He did not come to Switzerland in 1942 either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: Then Schacht was not in Switzerland
either in 1942 or 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: In all the time that you yourself lived in
Switzerland, did you ever meet the Defendant Schacht or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, repeatedly. I was in Berlin at least every 4
weeks or 8 weeks and until 1943...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: No. I am asking you about Schacht’s visit
to Switzerland.
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: During the war there was only one visit to Switzerland
by Schacht—in 1941, on the occasion of his wedding trip, and
then I saw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: That was in 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: On 14 January 1946, an article was
published in the newspaper <span class='it'>Basler Nachrichten</span>, entitled “What
Schacht Thinks.” Do you know anything about that article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: What do you know about that article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Not more than I read in the paper about it. I have
tried to find out who that American was with whom Schacht had the
conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: The details do not interest me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One last question: Did you know anything about a conference
held at Hitler’s house in Berchtesgaden, in the summer of 1944, when
the advisability of killing imported foreign workers was discussed,
in the case of further successful advances by the Allied Forces? Did
you hear anything about that conference?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, at that time I could not go to Germany any
more, because there were proceedings against me, and I heard
nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. ALEXANDROV: I have no further questions to ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then do you wish to re-examine, or does any
other member of the defendants’ counsel wish to ask questions of
the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, yesterday during the cross-examination
the American prosecutor submitted to you a letter of
14 May 1935 by the Reich Minister of Justice to the Reich and
Prussian Minister of the Interior. In that letter there is an enclosure
which mentions a copy of a letter by an inspector of the Secret
State Police. Witness, did I understand you correctly to say that
you personally assisted in writing that letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: We had cross-connections between the Ministry of
the Interior and the Ministry of Justice, and at times it was desirable,
if a letter of a severe nature came from another ministry,
for me to present it to my minister. And I do not doubt that Frick
was also glad when he received a sharp letter, so that he could
submit a matter in a general way and before the Cabinet. Thus I
remember that the sending of that letter was discussed in advance
with several gentlemen of the Ministry of Justice and with myself.
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Do I understand you correctly then that
the letter was a joint effort of the Ministry of Justice and the
Ministry of the Interior to do something against the Gestapo terror?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: As for myself, I can certainly say “yes.” I was at
that time a member of the Ministry of the Interior. Of course I did
not speak to my chief about that point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: In that letter we find on Page 5 of the
German text the following sentence—I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the concentration camp at Hohnstein in Saxony, inmates
had to stand under a dripping apparatus especially constructed
for that purpose, until the drops of water, falling at
regular intervals, produced serious infected injuries on the
scalp.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know that the guards of that camp were heavily punished
for that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, and if that happened it was an astounding
exception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Witness, then I have one more question.
That is in connection with the statement which you just made, that
there was an atmosphere of hostility toward you in the room of
the attorneys due to the incident which has been mentioned. A
number of colleagues are deeply shocked by that statement of
yours, and these colleagues were glad that you described conditions
in Germany so openly. Could you tell me whether that statement
you made applies to all of the Defense Counsel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I am grateful to you that you give me the opportunity
to correct an apparent misstatement, or a misunderstanding
which was created by my statement. I meant a different incident
which occurred as I entered the counsel room, about which I do not
want to speak any further here. I wish to emphasize that I realize
the difficult task of the Defense Counsel, and that I want to apologize
if in any way the impression was created or might be created
that I had reproached the great majority of the Defense Counsel
in the carrying out of their difficult task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: I thank you. I have no more questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Gisevius, I want to ask you some
questions to try and get clear what your various positions were and
where you were at various times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I understand it, in 1933 you were a civil servant, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then you became a member of the
Gestapo?
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The first position I held as a qualified civil servant
was in the service of the Political Police. In Germany one is a civil
servant even in the training stage. Therefore I have to say that I
received my first real position as an official in August of 1933 when
I entered the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And when did you leave that position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: The end of December 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And to what position did you go?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Then I entered the Ministry of the Interior; that is
to say, the Prussian Ministry of the Interior. In the course of the
year 1934 I also entered the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and in
May of 1935 I was dismissed from the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I came into the newly created, or to-be-created, Reich
Criminal Office, which, at its beginning, was the Police Presidium
in Berlin. On the date when Himmler was appointed Reich Chief
of Police, on 17 June 1936, I was finally dismissed from the police
service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was then transferred to the Government office in Münster,
worked there in price control supervision, and, in the middle of
1937, I took an unpaid vacation, ostensibly to make studies in
economics. That vacation was canceled by the Ministry of the
Interior at the beginning of 1939, and I was attached to the Government
office in Potsdam near Berlin. There I had to do with road
building...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In the middle of 1937 you took unpaid
service and studied in economics, I think you said, or an unpaid
vacation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You still remained a member of the civil
service then, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes; until the 20th of July I was continuously in the
civil service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then, in the beginning of 1939 you were
posted to the Ministry of the Interior and attached to Potsdam?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, go on; after that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: When war broke out the difficulty arose that I had
no mobilization order and, on the other hand, my friends wanted
to have me in the OKW. From the date of the outbreak of the war
until 1 October 1940 I had only a forged mobilization order, and
every day I expected to be found out. At which time I would have
had to take the consequences.
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>After the fall of Paris I stated to Canaris and Oster that I would
have to ask them now to release me from that somewhat complicated
situation. At that time the position of Canaris, temporarily,
was so strong that he placed me in an intelligence position with the
Consulate General in Zürich. There I received the title of a Vice
Consul with the Consulate General in Zürich, and I stayed there as
a counterintelligence man, without belonging to the Abwehr formally,
until 20 July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After 20 July I was dismissed from all posts, and I do not know
whether I was not even deprived of citizenship. I have found out
nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Between the time you went to Zürich and
20 July, were you returning to Germany from time to time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: During that time I was mainly in Germany, and
only from time to time Oster and Canaris sent me to Switzerland
as a courier, on travel orders. Schacht was still quite helpful to me
at that time in getting me a Swiss visa, through the Swiss Legation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: During the time that you were in the Gestapo,
from August to December 1933, what was your actual job or
function?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: When I received my first civil service position I was
only in training, and I was attached to the then Chief of the Executive
Department, Oberregierungsrat Nebe, for training. After the
warrant for arrest was issued, at the end of October 1933, I was
sent to Leipzig as a reporter for the Reichstag Fire trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You spoke yesterday very often of a man
whose name I am not clear about, Nebe, I believe it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What was his position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Nebe was a well-known criminologist at the Berlin
Police headquarters before 1933. As a National Socialist he was
called into the Gestapo in July 1933 and until the beginning of 1934;
he was promoted there to Oberregierungsrat. Then we were successful,
with the aid of the Defendant Frick, in having him transferred
for some time to the Ministry of the Interior. And then he became
the founder and Chief of the Reich Office of Criminology. On the
day of the appointment of Himmler as Chief of Police of the Reich
he was put into the new Reich Security Main Office. In the course
of time he was taken over into the SS; he became an SS Gruppenführer,
SS General, and, until 20 July, he was one of the closest
subordinates of the Defendant Kaltenbrunner. The Defendant Kaltenbrunner
was Chief of the Gestapo as well as the Criminal Police
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
and the Information Service. So that thereby Nebe became a subordinate
of Kaltenbrunner and received continuously official orders
from him, just like the Gestapo Chief Müller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you wish to ask any questions, Dr. Dix?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, perhaps we had better do that after
the adjournment at a quarter past 2.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1415 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Soviet Prosecutor put a question to you in connection
with the annexation of Austria. While answering the
question you were interrupted. You had just said, I quote “But
the form...” Would you please complete your answer now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: What I wanted to say was that Schacht was undoubtedly
opposed to the Anschluss in this form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then I have one last question, which concerns the
so-called incident of yesterday. I discussed this incident with you
yesterday and explained the situation as regards my colleague
Dr. Stahmer. I also gave you permission to make use of this explanation
at any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now request you to give this explanation to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May I interpose an objection. I
think that is a most irregular way to inform the Tribunal, if there
is anything the Tribunal should be informed about, that Dr. Dix
should tell the witness what the witness should tell the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I have no objection to the witness’ relating to the Tribunal
anything that he knows from his own knowledge. I do object
to the witness’ being asked to relate what Dr. Dix has told him
he may tell the Tribunal. I think that is a most irregular way of
clarifying it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is not the case. I made a remark about
Dr. Stahmer to Dr. Gisevius. That is a matter between the witness
and myself; I consider it important that this remark of mine be
related and testified to by the witness. It is an incident which he
observed, and I prefer that the witness should confirm the fact
that I explained this to him. I cannot see anything irregular about
this procedure, and I ask for a decision by the Tribunal. Otherwise
I should make the explanation myself, but I consider it better for
the witness to say what I told him immediately after that incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that you may properly
put the question to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I have already put the question, and you may answer
it at this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am not quite sure now what your question
was, but the Tribunal thinks that you may put the question. Was
there anything in connection with the incident which the witness
has not already told us, which he wishes to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes. The question relates to a conversation between
the witness and myself.
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, what did I tell you yesterday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: You told me immediately that, in your opinion, your
colleague Dr. Stahmer did not wish to put undue pressure upon
me but that this undue pressure came rather from the Defendant
Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, were you, during the war...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, are you attempting to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I wanted to put a single question...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I was not thinking of the time which you
would take up, but the question of whether you ought to be
allowed to put any question. Yes, go on, Dr. Seidl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Witness, during the war were you at any time
active in the intelligence service of a foreign power?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At no time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: It is also not correct...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is not a question which you ought to
put to this witness in re-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: But, Mr. President, it is a question affecting the
credibility of this witness. If it should turn out that this witness,
who is or was a citizen of the German Reich, had been active in
the intelligence service of a foreign power, that fact would have
an important bearing on the credibility of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I should like to be heard on that. In
the first place, I do not think that this witness should be subjected
to any attacks. In the second place, I respectfully submit that it
does not militate against the credibility of the witness that he
should have opposed this kind of an organization. I think that the
attack upon the credibility of this witness, if there were one to be
made—he is sworn on behalf of the defendants and is not the
Prosecution’s witness—the attack is not timely, is not a proper
attack, and the substance of it does not go to credibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will allow you to put the
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Please answer my question and remember your
oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Mr. Attorney, it is not at all necessary for you to
remind me of my oath. I have said that I was never in the intelligence
service of a foreign power. I was in the service of a good,
clean German cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: During the war did you receive funds from any
power at war with Germany?
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Do you know what the three letters OSS mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: What do they stand for?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: They stand for an American intelligence service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: You had nothing to do with that organization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I had friendly and political contacts with several
members of this organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I have no further questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I hope the defendants’ counsel will remember
that they have all had a free opportunity to cross-examine
this witness already and have not...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EGON KUBUSCHOK (Counsel for Defendant Von Papen):
The person of Herr Von Papen was not mentioned until the cross-examination
by the American prosecutor. Therefore I could not
ask questions before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, you replied in the negative to a question put by the
American chief prosecutor yesterday as to whether the Defendant
Von Papen at any time protested. Of course, you modified this
by pointing out that some written communication by Von Papen
had not been addressed to the Ministry of the Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to clarify this problem, I should like to know whether
this assertion of yours refers only to the Ministry of the Interior.
On Page 133 of your book you pointed out that one of the Defendant
Von Papen’s main activities as Vice Chancellor consisted
in handing in protests and that he addressed these protests above
all to Hindenburg and Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I again emphasized the latter point yesterday or
today. I have no official knowledge of any protest made by Von
Papen to the competent police minister after 30 June 1934. I can
say only that it would greatly have strengthened the position of
the ministry of police if a protest of that nature, describing in
detail the murder of Von Papen’s closest co-workers, had reached
the Ministry of the Interior. In that case, it is unlikely that this
rumor about the suicide or rather the suspicious death of Von Bose
and Jung would have reached the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Do you not think that it is understandable,
especially considering the position held by Frick, the comparatively
insignificant and uninfluential position held by Frick, that one
should make such protests to higher authorities if it is possible to
do so?
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: At the very moment when the ministers took the
position that they could apply only to higher authorities, that is,
the dictator himself, they, of their own accord, shattered the constitutional
competency of the individual ministries and the Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would have meant a great deal if Herr Von Papen at that
time had used the prescribed channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: In agreement with your book, you do not
dispute the fact that Von Papen made many protests to these
higher authorities in respect to other questions as well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No; he did protest frequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Yesterday, within the scope of your general
statements you gave an unfavorable characterization of the Defendant
Von Papen. This character sketch coincides with the one
you gave in your book. In your book you pay special attention
to certain details and draw your conclusions from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Defendant Von Papen only occupies a comparatively
small amount of space in your book and you probably had nothing
to do with him in your official capacity, you must have had to
base your statements on second-hand information. Since all these
statements, as far as they refer to Von Papen, are incorrect, I
refer to them briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, you proceed from the assumption that, in spite of the
events of 30 June, Von Papen did not resign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the contrary, it is historically significant that Papen did send
in his resignation after the suppression of his Marburg speech, that
negotiations about this resignation were pending between Hitler
and Hindenburg, and that Hitler accepted Papen’s resignation immediately
after the latter’s release on 3 July, when it was again
tendered, but did not intend to make it public until a later date,
in spite of Papen’s request to the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it possible, Witness, that you were not correctly informed of
this internal event?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It is perfectly possible for me not to have known
of internal events. I should like, however, to stress the fact that a
minister or vice chancellor is under an obligation to give a certain
amount of publicity to his opinion and to his decisions; and I can say
only that, whatever Papen may have said to Hitler in private, he
contrived with consummate skill to conceal from the German people
the fact that he intended to resign—or had already resigned; and
that is the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Are you aware that this same Defendant
Von Papen had had a very bad experience a few weeks earlier,
when the press was forbidden to publish his speech at Marburg,
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
which contained a frank statement of his opinions, and warning
was given that persons found circulating it would be punished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I am aware of it because we were appalled that
a Vice Chancellor of the German Reich allowed himself to be
silenced in such a way. I believe that the 30th of June would not
have involved such a heavy death-roll for the middle classes if Vice
Chancellor Von Papen had given a manly “no”—a definite “no”
at the proper time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Your answer makes no reference to the
point which I raised before, that Von Papen had actually resigned
because the publication of his Marburg speech had been prohibited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, you make the assumption that Von Papen took part
in the Cabinet session of 3 July, in which the law was passed that
the measures involved by 30 June were legal as emergency
measures for the protection of the State. Is it known to you that
Von Papen did not participate in this session, that he had just
been released and went into the Chancellery while the session was
in progress, that Hitler asked him to go from the session-room
into the adjoining room, that Von Papen again tendered his resignation,
which Hitler accepted, and that he left the Chancellery immediately
afterwards, without participating in the session at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not know whether it is possible for the
witness to follow your questions, but they are so long and contain
so many statements of fact that it is very difficult for anybody
else to follow them; it is very difficult for the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: The gist of my question was that Von
Papen did not attend the Cabinet session on 3 July. My question
to the witness...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kubuschok, why do you not ask the
witness whether he knows whether he did participate or not? If
that is the question you want to ask why do you not ask it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: My question is simply an attempt to find out
whether the assertion to the contrary which appears in his book
can also be explained by an error in information obtained from
a third party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It can be explained by false information, which,
through the silence of Herr Von Papen, became known to the
public and by which I myself was misled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Thirdly, you go on with the statement that
Von Papen, although he went to see Hindenburg afterwards, did
not make a sufficiently strong protest against the measures taken.
Is it known to you that Von Papen did everything in his power
to reach Hindenburg but was kept away from him and he did not
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
reach Hindenburg’s estate at Neudeck until after the 30th of June,
after Hindenburg’s death? Can the assertion to the contrary contained
in your book be traced back to an error in information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, if you tell me that even in his capacity of Vice
Chancellor of the Reich he did not have access to the President
of the Reich and still remained in office, in spite of the fact that
there were foreign journalists, the foreign diplomatic corps, and
even a large number of Germans who heard of this attitude of a
German vice chancellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: But, Witness, you are forgetting that he
was a retired vice chancellor and had already been out of office for
several weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fourthly, you start with the premise that Von Papen attended
the Reichstag session at which the measures taken on 30 June
were justified. Do you know that Von Papen did not attend that
session in spite of Hitler’s summons to him to do so? Is it possible
that you could have been informed incorrectly on that point, too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I believe you have already asked me that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: No, this is not the Cabinet session; this is
the Reichstag session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, then I must be misinformed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Dr. Laternser approached the lectern.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, it seems to me that the Defense
has had every opportunity to interrogate this witness. After
the witness was examined by the Prosecution, after his cross-examination,
the Defense makes again an application to cross-examine
the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks, at any rate, that it is
perfectly able to manage its own proceedings without any interruptions
of this sort. We can deal with Dr. Laternser when he
makes his application to cross-examine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I understand, Mr. President. I merely wanted
to say that we would like to shorten the duration of the proceedings
as much as possible, and the Prosecution would like the
Defense to consider that the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I have several further questions
to put to the witness, arising from his cross-examination; I
assume that the Tribunal have no objection to my questioning him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, if they arise out of the cross-examination
of him.
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, yesterday, in answer to a question
of the American prosecutor, you expressed the opinion that a
Putsch against the then existing regime would have been possible
only with the co-operation of the generals but that the many discussions
which took place did not achieve this co-operation. I
should like to ask you, Witness, to which generals you spoke personally
about the existing plans for a Putsch on the part of your
group?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are not concerned with every general
in the German Army; you are only concerned with those who are
charged with being a criminal group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Your question must be addressed to them,
or with reference to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, Mr. President. Then I ask the Court’s
permission to describe to the witness the OKW and General Staff
circle so that he can answer my question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you can put to him, I think, whether
he had contact with any members of the General Staff who are
charged with being a criminal group. You know who the generals
are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes. I should like to make a few preliminary
remarks to the witness and then put the question. Witness...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now, what is the question you want to put?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: So that the witness can answer the question
within the limits prescribed by the Tribunal, I should like to give
the witness a brief explanation as to the circle of persons actually
belonging to this group and then ask him with which of these
persons he talked personally in order to win them over for the
Putsch intended by his groups. Otherwise...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you do it shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, the group General Staff and OKW
is held to include the holders of certain appointments from
February 1938 to May 1945. These appointments are as follows:
The Commanders-in-Chief of the various branches of the Armed
Forces...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are not going through the whole lot,
are you, 130 of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, the list is really quite short
and otherwise I cannot restrict my question as desired by the
Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not know what you mean. What I said
was, are you proposing to go through the whole 130 generals or
officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: No, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: The group includes those holding certain
appointments; briefly, all those who were commanders-in-chief
during the period February 1938 to May 1945. Now, I ask you,
with which generals of this group did you personally discuss the
subject of Putsch plans, in order to obtain their co-operation in a
Putsch, if such were made?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: You mean commanders-in-chief of groups?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Of armies, of army groups, branches of the
Wehrmacht, and General Staff chiefs of the Wehrmacht branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I have already mentioned Halder and Brauchitsch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: One question, Witness; did you discuss with
Field Marshal Von Brauchitsch an intended Putsch against the
regime or only against the Gestapo?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I discussed both with him; and in both cases he
answered in the affirmative and acted in the negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke to Halder and Witzleben. I knew Kluge well from the
old times. I do not know at what period he entered the category
to which you refer. At any rate my connection with Kluge was
never broken off. I may have talked to other individuals falling
within this category.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, but to discuss Putsch plans with a
high-ranking military leader is an event of some importance; if
you had had a discussion of this kind with a field marshal you
would surely remember it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: It was not such an important event as all that,
Mr. Attorney. Field marshals were not such important people in
the Third Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Laternser, the fact that these generals
were spoken to and refused to join a Putsch is not a crime within
the meaning of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, yesterday I explained that this
point is very important because it would exclude the assumption
of a conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid, Dr. Laternser, it is no good
answering me that a point is very important. What I asked you
was, how is it relevant to show that these generals discussed a
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
revolt against the regime? That, I am putting to you, is not a crime
within the meaning of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, but this circumstance would exclude the
assumption of the conspiracy alleged by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But does it preclude the possibility of a
conspiracy to make aggressive war? It has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: I did not quite understand that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The question of a revolt against the regime
in Germany is, it seems to me, not necessarily connected with the
conspiracy to carry out aggressive war; therefore, anything which
has to do with a revolt against the regime in Germany is not
relevant to the question which you have to deal with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, the conspiracy is assumed
precisely in connection with the wars of aggression; and if the high
military leaders turned against the regime to such an extent that
they discussed and even attempted a Putsch, there would be no
question of conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Laternser, the Tribunal think the proper
way of putting the question, which they understand you want to
put, is to ask which of the generals were prepared to join in a
revolt. You may put that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, in order to decide how far the
circle as a whole was willing to take part I must ask the witness
how many of them he spoke to and how many of those declared
themselves ready to act with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you might put that to him—how
many. Ask him how many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, that was the question I asked
at the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I said you may put it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, with how many generals of
this group did you discuss the matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: In the course of years it may have been a dozen or
several dozen, but I should like to say that it was the task of
Generaloberst Beck and Oster or Canaris to talk to these gentlemen
rather than mine. As regards names, I cannot give you much of
the information you want; on the other hand I can shorten your
question by saying that, unfortunately, very few of the leading
generals in the appointments referred to by the Prosecution ever
seriously declared their intention of helping to overthrow the
system.
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, that is exactly what I want to
know. You spoke to Field Marshal Von Brauchitsch, Halder, and
Witzleben?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: And Olbricht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: He did not belong to this group. You did
speak to these three, then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Also to Kluge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Regarding the intended Putsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: And of these four that you mentioned did
Field Marshal Von Witzleben agree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: They all agreed to begin with. Witzleben was the
only one who stuck to his word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Then he did participate in this Putsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Did I understand you correctly when you
said yesterday that the Putsch of 20 July originated mainly with
the Wehrmacht, that is, with the generals and the officers of the
General Staff, and that they intended to keep down as far as
possible the number of those taking part?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No, I did not make such an exact statement as that.
Under a terror regime, only the military circles are in a position
to carry out a Putsch; to this extent it is true to say that these
few generals who participated were the mainstay of the Putsch.
But on 20 July the main weight lay with the wide front of the
civilians who for years had fought for the generals and were invariably
disappointed by the generals. For this reason alone, because
the generals had repeatedly broken their word, we decided
this time that on 20 July we would wait until the generals had
really taken action, in order not to raise the hopes or burden the
conscience of many civilians all to no purpose. That is what I
meant by limitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Then the only Putsch which was actually
attempted was effected by generals and General Staff officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: And civilians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes. And the head of this group was, as you
testified, Generaloberst Beck?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: And he also belonged to the group indicated
under the name General Staff and OKW. Now, I have a further
question: Do you know of relations between these military leaders
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
and the Minister of Finance Popitz, who also had designs for a
Putsch and is even said to have negotiated with Himmler for the
purpose of doing away with Hitler; and do you know anything
about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, that is true. Popitz made great efforts to incite
the generals to make a Putsch and to assassinate him. I regret
that I did not mention his name at the right time. He too was one
of those who, from 1938 or 1939 on, did their best to overthrow
the regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Did you discuss that with Minister Popitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, repeatedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Did he tell you anything about the identity
of the high military leaders he had contacted for this purpose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Popitz was in contact with Beck in particular. He
is certain to have been in contact with Witzleben; he was in touch
with Halder and Brauchitsch. The list of his disappointments is no
shorter than the list of disappointments which all the rest of us
had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Did he himself call it a disappointment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Yes, he was bitterly disappointed. This bitter,
everlasting disappointment was our one topic of conversation, and
that was the difficulty confronting the civilians, Mr. Attorney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: There were no other possible ways of doing
away with Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: No. Since, through the fault of the generals, there
was no other means of power, constitutional or otherwise, left
in Germany, and the generals, who were the only armed power of
the nation, took their orders from Hitler, it was impossible to
organize opposition through any other circles. I may remind you
that after 1938 every attempt made by the Leftists to organize a
strike was punishable in the same way as mutiny in time of war,
and I remind you of the hundreds of death sentences imposed on
civilians under the war laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Now, a different subject. When...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that this matter has
been fully covered and is really not relevant. You have already
cross-examined this witness at some length before this, and the
Tribunal does not wish to hear any further evidence on this subject
in any further cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I have just finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, as regards the Fritsch crisis, when did you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I thought you said you had concluded?
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I am afraid I was misunderstood.
I have concluded those questions referring to an intended
Putsch and I should like to pass on to another point now and put a
question on the Fritsch crisis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: As regards the Fritsch crisis I should like to
ask the witness when he learned of the exact state of affairs and
whether he transmitted his knowledge to high military leaders or
caused that knowledge to be transmitted to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But the Fritsch crisis has nothing to do with
the charges against the High Command. The charges against the
High Command are crimes under the Charter, and the Fritsch
crisis has nothing whatever to do with that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Then I will withdraw that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, today in cross-examination...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What are you going to put to him now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I should like to ask the witness
now about some points which he made in reply to the American
chief prosecutor’s questions. I believe that some clarification is
necessary here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The principle is not whether you think the
clarification is necessary, but whether the Tribunal thinks it; and,
therefore, the Tribunal wishes to know what points you wish to
put to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, indeed. In the course of his testimony
today the witness mentioned the fact that he had in his possession
documentary evidence of murders in Poland and Russia. I wanted
to ask him who had prepared these reports and in particular
whether he is acquainted with a very thorough and scientifically
prepared report made by Blaskowitz, commander in Poland, and
intended for transmission to his superiors. That would be an extremely
important point. Generaloberst Blaskowitz is a member
of the group which I represent. From the facts to be shown, it is
clear that the members of this group have always taken a stand
against cruelty, if such cases were reported to them through official
channels. I must therefore establish whether these reports, the object
of which was to prevent atrocities, are to be ascribed to the
co-operation of generals belonging to the indicted group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: It seems to me, if I may suggest,
Your Honors, that counsel is under the apprehension that he has
here to deal with individual generals. We are dealing only with
the group. If what counsel says about General Blaskowitz is true,
that is a defense for him, and I am right to say that General
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
Blaskowitz did defy this Nazi conspiracy. And if that fact is ever
verified, he certainly should not be subject to penalties for the acts
which he stood up against.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to me that we are going into individual defenses here
under a misapprehension that this is the occasion to try each and
every one of the generals. We made no charge against them that they
either did or did not have a Putsch or a Fritsch affair. The Fritsch
affair is only referred to here as fixing the time when the Defendant
Schacht became convinced that aggressive warfare was the
purpose of the Nazi regime. The Putsch is only introduced because
in his defense Schacht says he tried to induce a Putsch. It enters
not at all into the case against the General Staff. And most of the
General Staff who took any part in the Putsch were hanged and I
cannot see how it could be any defense to those who remained
and are under trial that a Putsch was or was not conducted. It
seems that we are off the main track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I would like to define my
position with regard to this point. Unless I am permitted to ask
questions about the attitude of the members of this group and in
respect to such an important point, from which it is clear that they
combated atrocities, it is impossible for me to make clear to the
Tribunal the attitude typical of the high military leaders. It is
absolutely necessary for me to follow up such points, especially
since I have no other evidence material at my disposal; for I cannot
consider a group criminal unless—for instance—the majority of its
members actually committed crimes. I must be in a position to ask
in this case what position Generaloberst Blaskowitz took in regard
to the murders which took place in Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn to consider the
matter.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Laternser, the Tribunal considers that the
questions that you have been putting, if relevant at all, are only
extremely remotely relevant, and they cannot allow the cross-examination
to continue for any length of time, or the time of the
Tribunal would be wasted further. They think, and they rule, that
you may put the question which they understand you desire to put
in this form: The witness has spoken of reports which were received
by the group of which he has spoken about atrocities in the East,
and they think you may ask him who submitted those reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Witness, I should like you to answer this
question: With whom did these reports of murders in Poland and
Russia originate?
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: I know of one report made by Generaloberst Blaskowitz
during the first few months of the Polish campaign on the
basis of information received by him and the military offices under
him. Beyond that, as far as I know, such reports were compiled
only by the group Canaris-Oster. But I should not care to assert
that another report was not written by someone else somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: What was the aim of the report which Generaloberst
Blaskowitz submitted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GISEVIUS: Generaloberst Blaskowitz intended...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The report which one particular general
made does not tend to show that the group was either innocent or
criminal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, it helps us to find out what
the attitude of the group was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal think that the report of one
general is not evidence as to the criminality of the whole group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, is that question approved?
I asked about the aim of the report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No; the Tribunal is of the opinion that what
was contained in that report is not admissible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: I have no more questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness may retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Pannenbecker, that concludes your case, does it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: The case of the Defendant Frick is
hereby concluded, except for the answers to the interrogatories
which I have not yet received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Counsel for the Defendant Streicher,
Dr. Marx, go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANNS MARX (Counsel for Defendant Streicher): With the
permission of the Tribunal, Mr. President, I now call the Defendant
Julius Streicher to the witness box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Streicher took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>JULIUS STREICHER (Defendant): Julius Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The defendant repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, would you give the Tribunal first a short
description of your career?
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I should like to ask the Tribunal to let me make
a brief statement in respect to my defense. Firstly...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You really ought to answer the questions that
are put to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: My Lord, my defense counsel cannot say what
I must say now. I should like to ask permission—in short, my
defense counsel has not conducted and was not in a position to
conduct my defense in the way I wanted; and I should like to state
this to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Defendant, you understand that the Tribunal
does not wish to have its time taken up with unnecessary matters.
It has no objection to your stating what is material or to your
reading it if necessary. It hopes that you will be as brief as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I mention only facts, four facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Firstly, the Charter created for this International Military
Tribunal guarantees the defendant the right to an unhampered and
just defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, before the Trial began the defendants received a list
containing the names of the attorneys from whom the defendant
could choose his counsel. Since the Munich attorney whom I had
selected for my defense could no longer be put at my disposal, I
asked the Military Tribunal to put the Nuremberg attorney
Dr. Marx at my disposal. That was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirdly, when I met my counsel for the first time, I told him he
must expect, as my counsel, to be attacked before the public.
Shortly afterwards, an attack was made by a Communist newspaper
published in the Russian zone of Berlin. The International Tribunal
was compelled to make a public statement repudiating the attack
of that newspaper and assuring my counsel of the express protection
of the Military Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fourthly, although the statement made by the International
Military Tribunal left no doubt as to the fact that the Tribunal wished
to see the defense of the defendants unhampered, a renewed attack
occurred, this time by radio. The announcer said, “There are
camouflaged Nazis and anti-Semites among the defendants’ counsel.”
That these terroristic attacks were made with the intention of
intimidating the defendants’ counsel is clear. These terror attacks
might have contributed to the fact—that is my impression—that my
own counsel had refused to submit to the Tribunal a large number
of pieces of evidence which I considered important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifthly, I wish to state that I have not been afforded the possibility
of making an unhampered and just defense before this
International Military Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can rest assured that the Tribunal will
see that everything that, in the opinion of the Tribunal, bears upon
the case or is relevant to your case or is in any way material in
your case will be presented and that you will be given the fairest
opportunity of making your defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I thank you. From my life...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me, Mr. President; may I ask briefly to be
permitted to state my position. May it please the Court, when I
was asked to take over Herr Streicher’s defense, I naturally had
grave misgivings. I have...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, I do not think it is necessary,
really, for you to make any personal explanation at this stage. It is
very possible that the defendant may have different ideas about his
own defense. I think we had better let him go on with his defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Nevertheless, I should like to ask permission,
Mr. President, just to mention the following point: As attorney and
as defense counsel of a defendant I have to reserve for myself the
right to decide how I shall conduct the defense. If the client is of
the opinion that certain documents or books are relevant, and the
attorney is of the opinion that they are not, then that is a difference
of opinion between the counsel and his client.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Herr Streicher is of the opinion that I am incapable or not in
a position to conduct his defense, then he should ask for another
defense counsel. I am aware that at this stage of the proceedings
it would be very difficult for me to follow the matter to its logical
conclusion and ask to be relieved of this task of defense. I am not
terrorized by any journalist, but for a counsel to lose the confidence
of his own client is quite another matter; and for that reason I feel
bound to ask the Court to decide whether in these circumstances
I am to continue to defend my client.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks, Dr. Marx, that the
explanation and the statement which you have just made is in
accordance with the traditions of the legal profession and they
think therefore that the case ought to proceed and that you should
proceed with the case. Now, Defendant, will you go on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: About my life: I was born on 12 February 1885 in
a small village in Bavaria Swabia. I was the youngest of nine
children. My father was an elementary school teacher. I too became
a teacher at an elementary school. In 1909, after I had taught for
several years in my native district, I was called to the municipal
school in Nuremberg. Here I had the opportunity of contact with
the families of the working-class children in the suburbs and of
observing social contrasts. This experience led to my decision in
1911 to go into politics. I became a member of the Democratic Party.
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
As a young democratic speaker, I spoke at the Reichstag election
in 1912. The car put at my disposal was paid for by the banking
firm of Kohn. I stress this point because at that time I had occasion
to associate a good deal with Jews, even in the Democratic Party.
I must therefore have been fated to become later on a writer and
speaker on racial politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The World War came and I, too, went into the army as a lance
corporal in an infantry regiment. Then I became an officer in a
machine-gun unit. I returned home with both Iron Crosses, with
the Bavarian Order, and the rare Austrian Cross of Merit attached
to the Ribbon for Gallantry. When I had returned home, I had no
desire to go into politics again. I intended only to stay in private
life and devote myself to my profession. Then I saw the blood-red
posters of revolution in Germany and for the first time I joined the
raging masses of that time. At a meeting, when the speaker had
finished, I asked to be heard as an unknown person. An inner voice
sent me onto the platform and I spoke. I joined in the debate and
I spoke on recent happenings in Germany. In the November
revolution of 1918 the Jews and their friends had seized the political
power in Germany. Jews were in the Reich Cabinet and in all the
provincial governments. In my native Bavaria the Minister President
was a Polish Jew called Eisner-Kosmanowsky. The reaction
among the middle classes in Germany manifested itself in the form
of an organization known as Schutz und Trutzbund (Society for
Protective and Offensive Action). Local branches of this organization
were formed in all the large cities in Germany; and fate willed that
after I had again spoken at a gathering, a man came up to me and
asked me to come to the Kulturverein (Cultural Society) in the
Golden Hall and hear what they had to say there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way, Gentlemen of the Tribunal, I became involved in
what brings me here today. Destiny made of me what international
propaganda thought it had made. I was called a bloodhound—a
blood czar of Franconia; my honor was attacked, a criminal was
paid 300 marks to swear in this very hall that he had seen me, as
an officer in France during the war, rape a Madame Duquesne, a
teacher’s wife in Atis, near Peronne. It was 2 years before someone
betrayed him and the truth came out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen, the receipt for 300 marks was produced here in this
court. With 300 marks they tried to deprive me of my honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mention this case only because my case is a special case; and
if it is to be judged with justice, then I must be allowed to make
such a remark in passing. In this connection, I may say that it is no
coincidence that the first question asked me by the Soviet Russian
officer who interrogated me was whether I was a sex criminal.
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen, I told you how I was fated to be drawn into the
Schutz und Trutzbund. I told you what conditions were like in
Germany at the time, and it was therefore quite a natural development
that I no longer visited the centers of revolution to join in
debate. I felt myself impelled to call meetings of my own and so
I spoke for perhaps 15 years almost every Friday before about 5,000
to 6,000 people. I admit quite frankly that I went on making
speeches over a period of 20 years in the largest cities of Germany,
sometimes at meetings on sport fields and on public squares, to
audiences of 150,000 to 200,000 people. I did that for 20 years, and
I state here that I was not paid by the Party. The Prosecution will
never succeed, not even through a public appeal, in getting anybody
into this room who could testify that I had ever been paid. I still
had a small salary which continued after I was relieved of my
position in 1924. Nonetheless, I remained the one and only unpaid
Gauleiter in the Movement. It goes without saying that my writing
supported myself and my assistants later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, Gentlemen, in the year 1921—I return now to that
period—I went to Munich. I was curious because someone had said
to me, “You must hear Adolf Hitler some time.” And now destiny
again takes a hand. This tragedy can only be grasped by those
whose vision is not limited to the material, but who can perceive
those higher vibrations which even today have not had their full
outcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went to the Munich Bürgerbräukeller. Adolf Hitler was
speaking there. I had only heard his name. I had never seen the
man before. And there I sat, an unknown among unknowns. I saw
this man shortly before midnight, after he had spoken for 3 hours,
drenched in perspiration, radiant. My neighbor said he thought he
saw a halo around his head; and I, Gentlemen, experienced something
which transcended the commonplace. When he finished his
speech, an inner voice bade me get up. I went to the platform.
When Adolf Hitler came down, I approached him and told him my
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has submitted a document to the Tribunal which
recalls that moment. Adolf Hitler wrote in his book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>,
that it must have cost me a great effort to hand over to him the
movement which I had created in Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mention this because the Prosecution thought that these things
in Hitler’s book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, should be submitted and used against
me. Yes, I am proud of it; I forced myself to hand over to Hitler
the movement which I had created in Franconia. This Franconian
movement gave the movement which Adolf Hitler had created in
Munich and southern Bavaria a bridge to northern Germany. That
was my doing.
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1923 I took part in the first National Socialist revolution or,
rather, attempted revolution. It will go down in history as the
Hitler Putsch. Adolf Hitler had asked me to come to Munich for it.
I went to Munich and took part in the meeting in which Adolf Hitler
came to a solemn agreement with representatives of the middle
classes to go to northern Germany and put an end to the chaos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I marched with them up to the Feldherrnhalle. Then I was
arrested and, like Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess, and others, was taken
to Landsberg on the Lech. After a few months I was put up as
candidate for the Bavarian Parliament by the Völkischer Block and
was elected in the year 1924.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1925 after the Movement had been permitted again and Adolf
Hitler had been released from jail, I was made Gauleiter of Franconia.
In 1933 I became a deputy to the Reichstag. In 1933 or 1934
the honorary title of SA Gruppenführer was bestowed on me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In February 1940 I was given leave of absence. I lived for
5 years, until the end of the war, on my estate. At the end of
April I went to southern Bavaria, to the Tyrol. I wanted to commit
suicide. Then something happened which I do not care to relate.
But I can say one thing: I said to friends, “I have proclaimed my
views to the world for 20 years. I do not want to end my life by
suicide. I will go my way whatever happens as a fanatic in the
cause of truth until the very end, a fanatic in the cause of truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might mention here that I deliberately gave my fighting paper,
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, the subtitle, <span class='it'>A Weekly for the Fight for Truth</span>. I was
quite conscious that I could not be in possession of the entire truth,
but I also know that 80 or 90 percent of what I proclaim with conviction
was the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, why were you dismissed from the teaching
profession? Did you ever commit any punishable or immoral act?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Actually I have answered this question already.
Everybody knows that I could not have been active publicly in this
profession if I had committed a crime. That is not true. I was
dismissed from my profession because the majority of the parties in
the Bavarian Parliament in the fall of 1923, after the Hitler Putsch,
demanded my dismissal. That, Gentlemen, was my crime of
indecent behavior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You know that two charges are made against you.
First, you are accused that you were a party to the conspiracy
which had the aim of launching a war, or wars, of aggression
generally, of breaking treaties and by so doing, or even at an earlier
stage, of committing Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, you are accused of Crimes against Humanity as such.
I should like to ask various questions on the first point now. Did
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
you ever have discussions with Adolf Hitler or other leading men
of the State or the Party at which the question of a war of aggression
was discussed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I can answer that with “no” right away, but I
should like to be permitted to make a short statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1921, as I have already said, I went to Munich; and before the
public on the platform I handed over my movement to the Führer.
I also wrote him a letter in this connection later. No other conference
took place with Adolf Hitler or any other person. I returned
to Nuremberg and went on making speeches. When the Party
program was proclaimed I was not present. That announcement,
too, was made in public; the conspiracy was so public that political
opponents could make attempts at terrorization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To sum up: At none of the secret meetings was any oath taken
or anything agreed upon which the public could not have known.
The program stood; it had been submitted to the Police; on the
basis of the law governing organizations the Party, like other
parties, was entered in the register of organizations. So that at that
time there was no conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, one of the most important points of the
Party program was the demand, “Freedom from Versailles.” What
were your ideas as to the possibility of some day getting rid of the
Versailles Treaty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I think I can state that very shortly. I believe the
Tribunal has known this for some time. Of course you will sometimes
find one traitor in a people—like the one who was sitting here
today; and you will also find unlimited numbers of decent people.
And after the last war these decent people themselves took up the
slogan, “Freedom from Versailles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If Your Honor pleases, I think I must
object to this sort of procedure. This witness has no right to call
another witness a traitor. He has not been asked any question to
which that is a response, and I ask that the Tribunal admonish him
in no uncertain terms and that he confine himself to answering the
questions here and that we may have an orderly proceeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, you will observe that injunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I ask the Tribunal to excuse me. It was a slip of
the tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The observation that you apparently made
I did not catch myself, but it was made with reference to a witness
who has just given evidence here and you had no right at all to
call him a traitor or to make any comment upon his evidence.
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, you will please refrain from making
such remarks. Adolf Hitler always spoke on the anniversary days
of the Party about a sworn fellowship. What do you say about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Sworn fellowship—that meant that he, Hitler, was
of the conviction that his old supporters were one with him in
thought, in heart, and in political loyalty—a sworn fellowship
sharing the same views and united in their hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Would not that mean that a conspiracy existed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Then he would have said we were a fellowship of
conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was there any kind of close relationship between
you and the other defendants which could be termed a conspiracy,
and were you better acquainted or did you have especially close
relations with any one of these defendants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Inasmuch as they were old members of the Party
we were one community of people with the same convictions. We
met at Gauleiter meetings; or when one of us spoke in the other’s
Gaustadt, we saw one another. But I had the honor of getting to
know the Reich Ministers and the gentlemen from the Army only
here. A political group therefore—an active group—certainly did
not exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: In the early days of the Party what solution was
foreseen for the Jewish problem?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Well, in the early days of the Party, the solution
of the Jewish problem was never mentioned just as the question of
solving the problem of the Versailles Treaty was never mentioned.
You must remember the state of chaos that existed at that time in
Germany. An Adolf Hitler who said to his members in 1933, “I shall
start to promote a war,” would have been dubbed a fool. We had
no arms in Germany. Our army of 100,000 men had only a few
big guns left. The possibility of making or of prophesying war was
out of the question, and to speak of a Jewish problem at a time
when, I might say, the public made distinctions with respect to Jews
only on the basis of religion, or to speak of the solution of this
problem, would have been absurd. Before 1933, therefore, the
solution of the Jewish problem was not a topic of discussion. I never
heard Adolf Hitler mention it; and there is no one here of whom
I could say I ever heard him say one word about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: It is assumed that you had particularly close relations
with Adolf Hitler and that you had considerable influence on
his decisions. I should like to ask you to describe your relations
with Adolf Hitler and to clarify them.
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Anyone who had occasion to make Adolf Hitler’s
acquaintance knows that I am correct in saying that those who
imagined they could pave a way to his personal friendship were
entirely mistaken. Adolf Hitler was a little eccentric in every
respect and I believe I can say that friendship between him and
other men did not exist—a friendship that might have been described
as intimate friendship. It was not easy to approach Adolf
Hitler; and any one who wanted to approach him could do so only
by performing some manly deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you ask me now—I know what you mean by that question—I
may say that before 1923 Adolf Hitler did not trust me. Although
I had handed over my movement to him unreservedly, he sent
Göring—who later became Marshal of the Reich—some time later to
Nuremberg. Göring was then a young SA leader—I think he was
an SA leader—and he came to investigate matters and to determine
whether I or those who denounced me were in the right. I do not
mean this as an accusation, but merely as a statement of fact. Soon
after that he sent a second and then a third person—in short, he did
not trust me before 1923.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came Munich and the Putsch. After midnight, when most
of them had left him, I appeared before him and told him that the
public must be told now when the next great day would come. He
looked at me intently and said, “Will you do it?” I said, “I will do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maybe the Prosecution has the document before it. Then, after
midnight, he wrote on a piece of paper, “Streicher will be responsible
for the entire organization.” That was to be for the following day,
11 November; and on 11 November I publicly conducted the propaganda,
until an hour before the march to the Feldherrnhalle. Then
I returned and everything was in readiness. Our banner—which was
to become a banner of blood—flew in front. I joined the second
group and we marched into the city towards the Feldherrnhalle.
When I saw rifle after rifle ranged before the Feldherrnhalle and
knew that now there would be shooting, I marched up 10 paces in
front of the banner and marched straight up to the rifles. Then
came the massacre, and we were arrested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have almost finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Landsberg—and this is the important part—Hitler declared
to me and to the men who were in prison with him, that he would
never forget this action of mine. Thus, because I took part in the
march to the Feldherrnhalle and marched at the head of the procession,
Adolf Hitler may have felt himself drawn to me more than
to the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the friendship born of the deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Have you finished?
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you consulted by Adolf Hitler on important
matters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I saw Adolf Hitler only at Gauleiter conferences;
when he came to Nuremberg for meetings we had meals together,
along with five, ten, or more people. I recall having been alone with
him only once in the Brown House at Munich, after the completion
of the Brown House; and our conversation was not a political one.
All the conversations which I had with Adolf Hitler, whether in
Nuremberg, Munich, or elsewhere, took place in the presence of
Party circle members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Now I come to 1933. On 1 April 1933 a boycott day
was decreed throughout the entire German Reich against the
Jewish population. What can you tell us about that and what part
did you play in it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: A few days before 1 April I was summoned to
the Brown House in Munich. Adolf Hitler explained to me something
that I already knew, namely, that a tremendous propaganda
campaign against the new Germany was being carried on by the
foreign press. Although he himself had only just become Chancellor,
although Hindenburg was still at the head of the Reich, although
Parliament existed, a tremendous campaign of hate against Germany
had begun in the foreign press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Führer told me that even the Reich flag, the emblem of
sovereignty, was being subjected to insults abroad and that we
would have to tell world Jewry, “Thus far and no farther.” We
would have to show them that we would not tolerate it any longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he told me that a boycott day was to be fixed for 1 April
and that I was to organize it. Perhaps it would not be irrelevant
to point out the following facts: Adolf Hitler thought that it might
be a good thing to use my name in connection with this boycott
day; that was not done in the end. So I undertook the organization
of the boycott and issued a directive, which I believe is in the
hands of the Court. There is no need for me to say much about it.
I gave instructions that no attempts should be made on the lives
of Jews, that one or more guards should be posted in front of all
Jewish premises—that is to say, in front of every Jewish store—and
that these guards should be responsible for seeing that no
damage was done to property. In short, I organized the proceedings
in a way which was perhaps not expected of me; and perhaps not
expected by many members of the Party. I frankly admit that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing is certain; except for minor incidents the boycott day
passed off perfectly. I believe that there is not even one Jew who
can contradict this. The boycott day was a disciplined proceeding
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
and was not “anti” in the sense of an attack on something. It has
a purely defensive connotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was a committee formed at the time consisting
of prominent, that is, leading members of the Party and did that
committee ever appear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: As to the committee, it was like the Secret Cabinet
Council in Berlin, which never met. In fact, I believe that all the
members of the Cabinet did not even see each other or get to know
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The committee members?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The boycott committee, that was put in the newspapers
in Berlin by Goebbels. That was a newspaper story. I spoke
to Goebbels on the telephone once. He asked how things were
going in Munich, where I was. I said that everything was going
perfectly. Thus no conference ever took place; it was only done
for effect, to make it appear a much bigger thing than it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, you made a mistake a few minutes ago,
speaking of the Munich affair in 1923. You meant 9 November—or
did you not—9 November 1923, and what did you say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: It should be 9 November 1923?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: 9 November 1923.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. The so-called “Racial Law” was promulgated
at the Reich Party Day in Nuremberg in 1935. Were you consulted
about the planning and preparation of the draft of that law; and
did you have any part in it, especially in its preparation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, I believe I had a part in it insofar as for
years I have written that any further mixture of German blood
with Jewish blood must be avoided. I have written such articles
again and again; and in my articles I have repeatedly emphasized
the fact that the Jews should serve as an example to every race, for
they created a racial law for themselves—the law of Moses, which
says, “If you come into a foreign land you shall not take unto yourself
foreign women.” And that, Gentlemen, is of tremendous importance
in judging the Nuremberg Laws. These laws of the Jews
were taken as a model for these laws. When, after centuries, the
Jewish lawgiver Ezra discovered that notwithstanding many Jews
had married non-Jewish women, these marriages were dissolved.
That was the beginning of Jewry which, because it introduced these
racial laws, has survived throughout the centuries, while all other
races and civilizations have perished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, this is rather too much of a digression.
I asked you whether you took part in planning and working
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
out the draft of the law, or whether you yourself were not taken
by surprise when these laws were promulgated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I was quite honest in saying that I believe I have
contributed indirectly to the making of these laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But you were not consulted on the law itself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No. I will make a statement, as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Reich Party Day in Nuremberg in 1935, we were summoned
to the hall without knowing what was going to happen—at
least I myself had no knowledge of it—and the racial laws were
proclaimed. It was only then that I heard of these laws; and I
think that with the exception of Herr Hess, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, this is true
of most of the gentlemen in the dock who attended that Reich
Party Day. The first we heard of these decrees was at the Reich
Party Day. I did not collaborate directly. I may say frankly that
I regarded it as a slight when I was not consulted in the making
of these laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: It was thought that your assistance was not necessary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you of the opinion that the 1935 legislation
represented the final solution of the Jewish question by the State?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: With reservations, yes. I was convinced that if
the Party program was carried out, the Jewish question would be
solved. The Jews became German citizens in 1848. Their rights as
citizens were taken from them by these laws. Sexual intercourse
was prohibited. For me, this represented the solution of the Jewish
problem in Germany. But I believed that another international
solution would still be found, and that some day discussions would
take place between the various states with regard to the demands
made by Zionism. These demands aimed at a Jewish state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What can you tell us about the demonstrations
against the Jewish population during the night of 9 to 10 November
1938, and what part did you play in it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, if you are going into that, it is
now 5 o’clock; and I think we had better adjourn now until Monday
morning.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 29 April 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEENTH DAY</span><br/> Monday, 29 April 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Tribunal: Before
continuing with questions to the Defendant Streicher, may I ask
permission to make a statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Friday afternoon, Herr Streicher referred to a case, namely,
that press event which concerned me and my professional attitude.
I thereupon took the opportunity to refer to this case in my statement
as well, and I pointed out that at that time I had had to ask
for the protection of the Tribunal against this damaging attack on
my work and that this protection was given me very graciously.
On that occasion and in that extemporary explanation I used the
expression “newspaper writer.” I used it exclusively with reference
to the particular journalist who had written the article in question
in that Berlin newspaper regarding my person and my activity
as a lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By no means did I express, or mean to express, a reference to
the press in general. It was far from my intention in any way to
attack the press, the group of press experts, and particularly not
the members of the world press who are active here; nor did I wish
to injure their professional honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason for this statement of mine is a statement made on
the radio, according to which I, the attorney Marx, had attacked
and disparaged the press in general. I am, of course, aware of the
significance of the press. I know precisely what the press has to
contribute and I should be the last person to fail to recognize fully
the extremely difficult work and the responsible task of the press.
May I, therefore, quite publicly before this Tribunal ask that this
statement be accepted; and may I ask the gentlemen of the press
to receive my statement in the spirit in which it is made, namely,
that this was merely a special comment on that particular gentleman
and not in any way on the entire press. That is what I
wanted to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, the Tribunal understood your
statement the other day in the sense in which you have now explained
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. With the permission of the Tribunal, I shall
then continue with my examination.
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, what aims did you pursue with your speeches and
your articles in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The speeches and articles which I wrote were
meant to inform the public on a question which appeared to me
one of the most important questions. I did not intend to agitate
or inflame but to enlighten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Apart from your weekly journal, and particularly
after the Party came into power, were there any other publications
in Germany which treated the Jewish question in an anti-Semitic
way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Anti-Semitic publications have existed in Germany
for centuries. A book I had, written by Dr. Martin Luther,
was, for instance, confiscated. Dr. Martin Luther would very
probably sit in my place in the defendants’ dock today, if this book
had been taken into consideration by the Prosecution. In the book
<span class='it'>The Jews and Their Lies</span>, Dr. Martin Luther writes that the Jews
are a serpent’s brood and one should burn down their synagogues
and destroy them...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, that is not my question, I am
asking you to answer my question in accordance with the way I
put it. Please answer now with “yes” or “no,” whether there
were...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I should like to interpose an objection
to this method of answering unresponsively and with speeches here.
We are utterly unable in this procedure to make objections when
answers are not responsive to questions. We have already got into
this case, through Streicher’s volunteered speeches, an attack on the
United States which will take considerable evidence to answer if
we are to answer it. It seems to me very improper that a witness
should do anything but make a responsive answer to a question,
so that we may keep these proceedings from getting into issues
that have nothing to do with them. It will not help this Tribunal,
in deciding Streicher’s guilt or innocence, to go into questions which
he has raised here against us—matters that are perfectly capable
of explanation, if we take time to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to me that this witness should be admonished, and
admonished so that he will understand it, if that is possible, that
he is to answer questions and stop, so that we can know and
object in time to orations on irrelevant subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, will you try, when you put the
questions to the witness, to stop him if he is not answering the
questions you put to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, Mr. President. I was just in the process...
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Defendant Streicher, you understand, you
have heard what has been said and you will understand that the
Tribunal cannot put up with your long speeches which are not
answers to questions which we put to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I will now repeat the question and I want you to
answer the question first with “yes” or “no” and then to add a
brief explanation regarding the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from your weekly journal, and particularly after the
Party came into power, were there other publications in Germany
which dealt with the Jewish question in an anti-Semitic way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, even before the coming to power there were
in every Gau weekly journals that were anti-Semitic and one
daily paper called the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> in Munich. Apart
from that, there were a number of periodicals which were not
working directly for the Party. There was also anti-Semitic literature.
After the seizure of power, the daily press was co-ordinated,
and now the Party found itself in control of some 3,000 daily
papers, numerous weekly journals, and all type of periodicals; and
orders were given by the Führer that every newspaper should
provide enlightening articles on the Jewish question. The anti-Semitic
enlightenment was, therefore, after the seizure of power,
carried out on a very large scale in the daily press as well as in
the weekly journals, periodicals, and books. Consequently, <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span> did not stand alone in its enlightening activity. But I
want to state quite openly that I make the claim of having treated
the question in the most popular way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were the directives necessary for this issued by a
central office, say, for instance, by the National Socialist press
service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. The Propaganda Ministry in Berlin had a
National Socialist press service. In this service, in every issue, there
were a number of enlightening articles on the Jewish question.
During the war the Führer personally gave the order that the
press, far more than previously, should publish enlightening articles
on the Jewish question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The Prosecution accuse you of having contributed
indirectly to mass murders by incitation, and according to the
minutes of 10 January 1946, the following charge has been made
against you: No government in the world could have undertaken
a policy of mass extermination, as it was done here, without having
behind it a nation which agreed to it; and you are supposed to
have brought that about. What have you to say to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: To that I have the following to say: Incitation
means to bring a person into condition of excitement which causes
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
him to perform an irresponsible act. Did the contents of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
incite, this is the question? Briefly stated, the question must be
answered, “What did <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> write?” Several volumes of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> are available here, but one would have to look at
all the issues of 20 years in order to answer that question exhaustively.
During those 20 years I published enlightening articles
dealing with the race, dealing with what the Jews themselves
write in the Old Testament, in their history, what they write in
the Talmud. I printed excerpts from Jewish historical works,
works for instance, written by a Professor Dr. Graetz and by a
Jewish scholar, Gutnot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> no editorial appeared written by me or written
by anyone of my main co-workers in which I did not include quotations
from the ancient history of the Jews, from the Old Testament
or from Jewish historical works of recent times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is important, and I must emphasize that I pointed out in all
articles, that prominent Jews, leading authors themselves, admitted
that which during 20 years as author and public speaker I publicly
proclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allow me to add that it is my conviction that the contents of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> as such were not incitation. During the whole 20 years
I never wrote in this connection, “Burn Jewish houses down; beat
them to death.” Never once did such an incitement appear in
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now comes the question: Is there any proof to be furnished that
any deed was done from the time <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> first appeared, a
deed of which one can say that it was the result of an incitement?
As a deed due to an incitement I might mention a pogrom. That
is a spontaneous deed when sections of the people suddenly rise up
and kill other people. During the 20 years no pogrom took place
in Germany, during the 20 years, as far as I know, no Jew was
killed. No murder took place, of which one could have said, “This
is the result of an incitement which was caused by anti-Semitic
authors or public speakers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen, we are in Nuremberg. In the past there was a
saying that nowhere were the Jews in Germany so safe and so
unmolested as in Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, is not this becoming a rather
lengthy speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Streicher, you have explained this now sufficiently,
so that one can form an opinion—you mean, “I have not incited
in such a way that any spontaneous action carried out against the
Jews by any group of people or by the masses resulted”?
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: May I make a remark in this connection? Here
we are concerned with the most serious, the most decisive accusation
raised against me by the Prosecution, and here I ask the
Tribunal to permit me to defend myself against it objectively. Is
it not of tremendous significance if I can establish that in Nuremberg,
of all places, no murder took place, no single murder and no
pogrom either? That is a fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have already said it. I have just
written down, before I intervened, saying that no Jews have been
killed not only in Nuremberg but anywhere else as a result of your
incitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, we shall make reference to these demonstrations
of 9 and 10 November 1938 later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, but may I continue? The Indictment accuses
me of having indirectly contributed by incitation to mass
murders, and I ask to be allowed to make a statement on this:
Something has been ascertained today about which I myself did
not know. I learned of the will left behind by the Führer, and I
assume that a few moments before his death the Führer told the
world the truth in that will. In it he says that mass killings were
carried out by his order; that the mass killings were a reprisal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it is demonstrated that I, myself, cannot have been a
participant in the incredible events which occurred here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Finished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. You said that the Indictment accuses me in
saying that these mass killings could never have taken place if
behind the Government and behind the leaders of the State there
had not been an informed people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen, first of all, the question, “Did the German people
really know what was happening during the years of the war?” We
know today...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Defendant, that is a matter of argument and
not a matter upon which you can give evidence. You can say what
you knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I was a part of that nation during the war. During
the war I lived alone in the country. For 5 years I never left my
farm. I was watched by the Gestapo. From 1939 on I have been
forbidden by the Führer to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, we will certainly come to that later.
I have interrogated you now on this question, and I will proceed
with my questions. The other will come later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: But I wish to state that I had no opportunity—that
is why I said this—to learn what was actually going on.
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I first heard of the mass murders and mass killings at Mondorf
when I was in prison. But I am stating here that if I had been
told that 2 or 3 million people had been killed, then I would not
have believed it. I would not have believed that it was technically
possible to kill so many people; and on the basis of the entire
attitude and psychology of the Führer, as I knew it, I would not
have believed that mass killings, to the extent to which they have
taken place, could have taken place. Finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The Prosecution also raise the charge against you
that it was the task of the educators of the nation to educate the
people to murder and to poison them with hatred, that you had
devoted yourself particularly to these tasks. What do you want to
answer to this charge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is an allegation. We educated no murderers.
The contents of the articles which I wrote could not have educated
murderers. No murders took place, and that is proof that we did
not educate murderers. What happened during the war—well, I
certainly did not educate the Führer. The Führer issued the order
on his own initiative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I now continue. The Prosecution further assert
that the Himmler-Kaltenbrunner groups and other SS leaders
would have had no one to carry out their orders to kill, if you had
not made that propaganda and if you had not conducted the education
of the German people along these lines. Will you make a
statement on that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not believe that the National Socialists mentioned
read <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> every week. I do not believe that those
who received the order from the Führer to carry out killings or
to pass on the order to kill, were led to do this by my periodical.
Hitler’s book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, existed, and the content of that book
was the authority, the spiritual authority; nor do I believe that the
persons mentioned read that book and carried out the order on the
strength of it. Based on my knowledge of what went on in the
Movement, I am convinced that if the Führer gave an order everyone
acted upon it; and I state here quite openly that maybe fate
has been kind to me. If the Führer had ordered me to do such
things, I would not have been able to kill; but perhaps today I
would face some indictment which it has not been possible to lodge
against me. Perhaps because fate has taken a hand in this. But
the conditions were thus, that the Führer had such a power of
hypnotic suggestion that the entire people believed in him; his way
was so unusual that, if one knows this fact, one can understand
why everyone who received an order acted. And thus I want to
reject as untrue and incorrect what was here thought fit to assert
against me.
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What do you know about the general attitude of
Adolf Hitler to the Jewish question? And when did Hitler first
become hostile to the Jews, according to your knowledge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Even before Adolf Hitler became publicly known
at all I had occupied myself journalistically with anti-Semitic
articles. However, on the strength of his book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, I first
learned about the historic connections of the Jewish problem.
Adolf Hitler wrote his book in the prison in Landsberg. Anyone
who knows this book will know that Hitler many years back, either
by study of anti-Semitic literature or through other experiences,
must have developed this knowledge in himself in order then to be
able to write that book in prison in so short a time. In other words,
in his book Adolf Hitler stated to the world public that he was
anti-Semitic and that he knew the Jewish problem through and
through. He himself often said to me personally...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, the book <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> is in
evidence, and it speaks for itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I will now answer your question, not with reference
to the book. You asked me whether Adolf Hitler had discussed
the Jewish problem with me. The answer is “yes.” Adolf
Hitler always discussed the Jewish problem in connection with
Bolshevism. It is perhaps of importance in answering that question
to ask whether Adolf Hitler wanted a war with Russia. Did he
know long in advance that a war would come, or not? When he
was with us Adolf Hitler spoke of Stalin as a man whom he honored
as a man of action, but that he was actually surrounded by Jewish
leaders, and that Bolshevism...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, that is going too far again. The
question which I put was quite exact, and I am asking you not to
go so far afield. You have heard the Tribunal object to it, and in
the interest of not delaying the proceedings you must not go into
so many details. You must not make speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, I believe that some time ago
Mr. Justice Jackson remarked, quite justly, quite reasonably, that
the Defendant Streicher became so intoxicated by his own speeches
that he did not answer the questions put to him or the charges
made against him. I therefore invite the attention of the Tribunal
to this fact and suggest that the defendant abstain from making
lengthy speeches and merely give brief replies to the charges
brought against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you go on, Dr. Marx, and try to keep
the witness to an answer to the questions which you have no doubt
prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Very well, Mr. President.
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: May I, please, as a defendant, say a few words,
here? The question was...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] No, you may not. You will
answer the questions, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Next question. Is there reason for the assumption
that Hitler, when he decided to have the Jews in Europe killed in
masses, was subject to any influence, or what is to be considered
the motive for that dreadful decision?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The Führer could not be influenced. As I know
the Führer, if somebody had gone to him and said that Jews
should be killed, then he would have turned him down. And if,
during the war, somebody had gone to him and said, “I have
learned that you are giving the order that mass killings are to be
carried out,” then he would have turned that man down too. I
therefore answer your question by saying that the Führer could
not be influenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: In other words, you want to say that the decision
in this matter was made entirely on his own initiative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have already said that that becomes clear from
his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: In August 1938 the main synagogue in Nuremberg
was demolished. Was this done on your orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. In my Gau there were approximately 15 synagogues,
in Nuremberg one main synagogue, a somewhat smaller one,
and I think several other prayer rooms. The main synagogue stood
in the outskirts of the medieval Reichsstadt. Even before 1933,
during the so-called period of struggle, when we still had the other
government, I stated publicly during a meeting that it was a
disgrace that there should be placed in the Old City such an oriental
monstrosity of a building. After the seizure of power I told the
Lord Mayor that he should have the synagogue torn down, and at
the same time the planetarium. I might point out that after the
World War, in the middle of the park grounds laid out for the
recreation of the citizens, a planetarium had been built, an ugly
brick building. I gave the order to tear down that building and
said that the main synagogue, too, should be razed. If it had been
my intention to deprive the Jews of their synagogue as a church
or if I had wanted to give a general signal, then I would have
given the order, after the seizure of power, that every synagogue in
my Gau should be torn down. Then I would likewise have had all
the synagogues in Nuremberg torn down. But it is a fact that in
the spring of 1938 only the main synagogue was torn down; the
synagogue in the Essenweinstrasse, in the new city, remained untouched.
That the order was then given in November of that year
to set fire to the synagogues, that is no fault of mine.
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: In other words, you want to say that you did not
order the tearing down of this building for anti-Semitic reasons
but because it did not conform to the architectural style of
the city?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: For reasons of city architecture. I wanted to submit
a picture to the Tribunal on this, but I have not received any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, we have a picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: But you cannot see the synagogue in it. I do not
know whether the Tribunal want to see the picture. The picture
actually shows only the old houses, but the front of the synagogue
facing the Hans-Sachs-Platz is not visible. I do not know whether
I may submit the picture to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly, the photograph can be put in.
Let us see the photograph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: In that case, I will submit it to the Tribunal as
evidence and I am asking you to accept it accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What will it be, exhibit what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I cannot say at the moment, Mr. President. I shall
take the liberty of stating the number later and for the moment
I confine myself to submitting it. I could not present it any earlier
because I had not come into possession of this picture. It was
only in the last days...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: In your measure in connection with the main
synagogue did you rely on any statements of art experts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I had frequent opportunities to discuss the subject
with architects. Every architect said that there must have been a
city council which had no feeling whatsoever for city architecture,
that it was impossible to explain it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These statements were not in any way directed against the
synagogue as a Jewish church, but rather against such a building
in this part of the city. Strangers, too, whom I guided—for on
Party rally days I used to accompany British and American people
across the Hans-Sachs-Platz—and I remember only one case where
when I said “Do you not notice anything?” that the person did
not. But all other strangers said “How could that building get
there in the midst of these medieval buildings?” I could also have
submitted a book, written in 1877, which is in the prison library,
where a Professor Berneis, who was famous, wrote at that time
to the author, Uhde, in Switzerland, that he had now seen the
Sachs Platz...
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, that is enough now. In other words,
you have indicated that you believed you could rely on the judgment
of architects who seemed to you to be authorities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: At the time when the synagogue was demolished,
did you make a speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, but I want to point out that the Prosecution
have submitted an article, a report from the <span class='it'>Tageszeitung</span>, that
was written by a simple young man. I want to state that this article
does not contain a true representation of the statements which
I made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I now come to the demonstrations on the night of
9 to 10 November 1938. What can you say concerning those demonstrations
and what role did you play in that connection? Were
those demonstrations initiated by the population?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Every year the Gauleiter and SA and SS leaders
met the Führer in Munich on the occasion of the historic day of
9 November. We sat down to dinner in the old Town Hall, and it
was customary for the Führer to make a short speech after the
dinner. On 9 November 1938, I did not feel very well. I participated
in the dinner and then I left; I drove back to Nuremberg
and went to bed. Toward midnight I was awakened. My chauffeur
told me that the SA leader Von Obernitz wanted to talk to the
Gauleiter. I received him and he said the following: “Gauleiter,
you had left already when the Minister of Propaganda, Dr. Goebbels,
took the floor and said”—I can now repeat it only approximately—“said,
‘Legation Counsellor Vom Rath has been murdered
in Paris. That is now the second murder abroad of a prominent
National Socialist. This murder is not the murder by the Jew,
Grünspan; this is rather the execution of a deed which has been
desired by all Jewry. Something should now be done.’ ” I do not
know now whether Goebbels said the Führer had ordered it; I
remember only that Von Obernitz told me that Goebbels had stated
the synagogues were to be set on fire; and I cannot now remember
exactly, but I think he told me that the windows of Jewish business
houses were to be smashed and that houses were to be demolished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I said to Obernitz—for I was surprised—“Obernitz, I think
it is wrong that synagogues be set on fire, and at this moment I
think it is wrong that Jewish business houses be demolished; I
think these demonstrations are wrong. If people are let loose during
the night, deeds can be perpetrated for which one cannot be responsible.”
I said to Obernitz that I considered the setting on fire
of synagogues particularly wrong because abroad and even among
the German people the opinion might arise that National Socialism
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
had now started the fight against religion. Obernitz replied, “I
have the order.” I said, “Obernitz, I will not assume any responsibility
here.” Obernitz left and the action took place. What I
have said under oath here I have previously stated in several interrogations;
and my chauffeur will confirm it, for he was witness to
this night’s conversation, and shortly afterwards when he went to
bed told his wife what he had heard up there in my bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Have you finished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, but you asked another question...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, whether it was a spontaneous act of force
initiated by the masses of the people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. In the National Socialist press there appeared
after this action an article to the same effect, which stated that
a spontaneous demonstration of the people had revenged the murder
of Herr Vom Rath. It had therefore been deliberately ordered
from Berlin that there should be a public statement to the effect
that the demonstration of 1938 was spontaneous. That this was
not the case I was also able to learn in Nuremberg; and it is remarkable
that the indignation at what had happened during those
demonstrations expressed itself even here in Nuremberg, even
among the Party members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution have submitted an article which is a report on
a speech which I made on 10 November; and that is a remarkable
piece of evidence of the fact that the people were against this
action. I was forced, because of the atmosphere which prevailed in
Nuremberg, to make a public speech and say that one should not
have so much sympathy for the Jews. Such was the affair of
November 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it might also be important for you to ask me how I,
of all people, happened to oppose the idea of these demonstrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I thought you had explained that already. Very
well. Who gave the order then for the burning down of the synagogue
still standing on Essenweinstrasse?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know who gave the order; I believe it was
SA leader Von Obernitz. I do not know the details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: A further question: Did you yourself express
publicly your disapproval of these brutalities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. In a small circle of leading Party members
I said what I have always said, what I have always said publicly:
I stated that this was wrong. I talked to lawyers during a meeting—I
do not know whether my defense counsel himself was there—I
believe it was as early as November 1938 that I stated, to the
Nuremberg lawyers at a meeting, that what had happened here
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
during that action, was wrong; that it was wrong as regards the
people and as regards foreign countries. I said then that anyone
who knew the Jewish question as I knew it would understand why I
considered that demonstration a mistake. I do not know whether this
was reported to the Führer at that time, but after November 1938
I was never again called to the Hotel Deutscher Hof when the
Führer came to Nuremberg. Whether this was the reason I do not
know, but at any rate I did criticize these demonstrations publicly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: It is assumed by the Prosecution that in 1938 a more
severe treatment of the Jews was introduced. Is that true, and what
is the explanation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. In 1938 the Jewish question entered a new
phase; that is shown, indeed, by the demonstration. I myself can
only say in this connection that there was no preliminary conference
on this subject. I assume that the Führer, impulsive as he was and
acting on the spur of the moment, got around probably only on
9 November to saying to Dr. Goebbels, “Tell the organizations that
the synagogues must be burned down.” As I said, I myself did not
attend such a meeting; and I do not know what happened to bring
about this acceleration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: On 12 November 1938 the decree was published
according to which the Jews were to be eliminated from the economic
life of the country. Was there a connection between the orders
for the demonstrations of 9 November and that further decree of
12 November 1938, and would that decree be due to the same
reason?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Well, here I can say only that I am convinced that
there was a connection. The order, rather the decrees, which were
to have such an extensive effect in the economic field, came from
Berlin. We did not have any conference. I do not remember any
Gauleiter meetings in which that was discussed. I do not know of
any. That happened just as everything happened; we were not
previously informed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How was it that not you, but the Codefendant
Rosenberg, was given the task of attending to this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Rosenberg was the spiritual trustee of the Movement,
but he was not given this particular task nor the task of the
demonstration nor that of economic matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: No, we are talking of different points. Rosenberg
was the one given the task by the Leaders of the State of taking
care, as it was called, of racial-political and other enlightenment
tasks; and you were not. How can that be explained? How can
it be explained that you were not chosen?
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Rosenberg, as he himself said, had met the Führer
very early and was anyway, because of his knowledge, intellectually
suited to take over this task. I devoted myself more to popular
enlightenment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, he has told us that he wasn’t given
the task. Unless he had some communication with Rosenberg he
can’t tell us anything more about it except that he wasn’t given
the task. All the rest is mere comment and argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I now put the next question to you:
Was an order issued during the year 1939 forbidding you to make
speeches?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. In the autumn of 1939 my enemies went so
far that the Führer, without my being asked beforehand, issued a
written order through Party Member Hess forbidding me to make
speeches. The threat of immediate arrest was made should I act
against this order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it also correct that in 1938 an effort was evidently
made to stop further publication of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, I mean in government
circles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Such intentions existed quite often, and also at
that time. Perhaps I might refer to two other documents in this
connection in order to save time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution have submitted copies of a letter from Himmler
and Baldur von Schirach. Here I can give quite a simple explanation
right now. At that time, in 1939, there were intentions of prohibiting
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. Bormann had even issued some such order.
Then the Chief Editor of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> wrote to prominent members
of the Party, asking them to state their opinion about <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
And thereupon letters were also received from Himmler and Von
Schirach. Altogether, I think about 15 letters were received from
prominent members of the Movement; they were merely kind
replies to an inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: That is sufficient. Is it true that at the outbreak of
the war you were not made Armed Forces District Commissioner
(Wehrkreis-Kommissar) in your own Gau?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How can that be explained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Well, maybe that is not so important; that is how
conditions were at the time. There were certain personal feelings,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>; it is of no significance. At any rate, I did not become
Armed Forces District Commissioner.
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The Prosecution have stated that after 1 September
1939 the persecution of the Jews increased more and more. What
was that due to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That question only the Führer could answer; I
cannot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But do you not think this had something to do with
the outbreak of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The Führer always said so in public, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: A proceeding was instituted against you before the
Supreme Party Court. How did that happen? What was the development
and the result of that trial?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I am grateful that I have an opportunity to state
quite briefly before the International Military Tribunal something
which I have had to keep silent about up to now because of a
Führer order. I myself had instituted proceedings against myself
before the Supreme Party Court in order to defend myself against
people who were denouncing me. I was being accused...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is the defendant talking about some order
which Hitler gave that he was not to be allowed to speak or is he
talking about something else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>You remember, Dr. Marx, that certain allegations were struck
out of the record. If he is talking about those, it seems to me that
we have got nothing whatever to do with it. Am I right in recollecting
that something was struck out of the record?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes it was, Mr. President, but only certain things
from the Göring report were struck out, only the one passage which
concerned the affair with the three young persons; but everything
else was retained by the Prosecution. The Defense, therefore, must
be able to take a stand in regard to these points, if the Prosecution
do not say that they are dropping the entire Göring report; and in
that connection this proceeding before the Supreme Party Court
also plays a part. He can make a brief statement about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: All right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. It is important then that I instituted proceedings
against myself; about 10 points were involved which had
been raised against me, among them a matter referring to some
shares. An affidavit exists from the Göring report which states that
I had been found guilty. May I state here that the trial was never
completed and no sentence was passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the answer to the question which you have put to me.
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The matter referring to shares, does that have
something to do with the shares of the Mars works?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: We will come to it later. It was not the main
point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And then you were ordered to remain permanently
at the Pleikershof? Were you under the guard of the Gestapo
there, and was there also a check-up as far as visitors were concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: It is not correct that I was ordered to stay at the
Pleikershof. What is true is that I retired voluntarily with the
intention of never again being active in the Movement. It is correct
that the Gestapo watched me, and every visitor was called to the
police station and interrogated as to his conversations he had had.
That is a fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: During your stay at the Pleikershof did you have
any connections or correspondence with any leading personalities
of the Party or State?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No. As far as prominent persons of the Movement
and of the State are concerned, I had no correspondence whatsoever
with them; that is why the Prosecution could hardly find any
letters. I never stated in letters my opinion on the Jewish problem
or on other matters. I shall have to state then, in order to answer
your question exactly, that I had no correspondence with prominent
persons of the Party and the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: After the outbreak of the war, were you informed
of or consulted in any way on any measures intended against the
Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What were your relations to Himmler? Did you
know him at all closely? Did you ever speak to him about measures
against the Jews or did he talk about intended mass executions of
the Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I knew Himmler just as I knew the SA leaders,
or other SS leaders. I knew him from common meetings, Gauleiter
conferences, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. I did not have a single political discussion
with Himmler, except in society when he may have touched on this
or that, in the presence of others. The last time I saw Himmler
was in Nuremberg when he spoke to the officers in their mess.
When that was I cannot say exactly but I think it was shortly before
the war. I never had a talk with him on the Jewish question. He
himself was, of course, well informed on this question. He had an
organ of his own called the <span class='it'>Schwarze Korps</span>. And what his inner
attitude toward me was is something that I did not discover until
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
my stay on the farm. There were denunciations against me which
reached him. It was stated that I was being too humane with the
French prisoners. Shortly after that I received a letter in which
he reproached me and made serious representations against me. I
gave no answer at all. Without having made any previous inquiries
with me as to whether these denunciations were true, he
made a serious charge against me; and I state quite openly that it
was actually my feeling at the time that I might possibly lose my
liberty through arrest. These were my relations with Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: That is enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this Trial you have heard mentioned the names of a
great number of Higher SS and Police Leaders who played a
leading part in the Jewish persecutions, as for instance, Heydrich,
Eichmann, Ohlendorf, and so on. Were there any connections between
you and one of these Higher SS and Police Leaders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I heard the names you have mentioned for the
first time during an interrogation here. I did not know these men;
they may well have seen me, but there was never a discussion
involving me and the senior SS or SA leaders. Furthermore, I
never was in any of Himmler’s offices in Berlin, or any Ministry
in Berlin. Thus, no conference ever took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The Prosecution have drawn the conclusion from
numerous articles in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, that as early as 1942 and 1943
you must have had knowledge of the mass executions of Jews
which had taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What statement can you make on this, and when, and in what
way, did you hear of the mass executions of Jews which took place
in the East?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I had subscribed to the Jewish weekly that appeared
in Switzerland. Sometimes in that weekly there were intimations
that something was not quite in order; and I think it was at the
end of 1943 or 1944—I believe 1944—that an article appeared in
the Jewish weekly, in which it said that in the East—I think it was
said in Poland—Jews were disappearing in masses. I then made
reference to this in an article which perhaps will be presented to
me later. But I state quite frankly that the Jewish weekly in
Switzerland did not represent for me an authoritative source, that
I did not believe everything in it. This article did not quote figures;
it did not talk about mass executions, but only about disappearances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Have you finished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you make proposals in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> for the
solution of the Jewish question, during the war?
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And in what sense?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: As I said yesterday, I represented the point of
view that the Jewish question could be solved only internationally,
since there were Jews in all countries. For that reason we published
articles in my weekly journal referring to the Zionist demand
for the creation of a Jewish state, such as had also been provided
for or indicated in the Balfour Declaration. There were therefore
two possibilities for a solution, a preliminary solution within the
countries through appropriate laws; and then the creation of a
Jewish state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the war, I think it was in 1941 or 1942, we had written
another article—we were subject to the Berlin censorship—and the
censorship office sent back the proof submitted with the remark
that the article must not be published in which we had proposed
Madagascar as the place for the establishment of a Jewish state.
The political relations with France were given as the reason why
that article should not be published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: If you had expected that question to be solved by
mass executions, would you then too have written this article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: At that time, at any rate, it would still have been
nonsensical to publish it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did it not make you uneasy to deal with the Jewish
question in a biased way, in a way which left completely out of
sight those qualities of the Jews which can be described as great?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I did not understand this question fully, perhaps
I did not hear it correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You can be accused of treating, in a biased way,
only those qualities of the Jews that appear disadvantageous to
you, whereas the other qualities of the Jewish people you ignored.
What is your explanation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I think that this question is really superfluous here.
It is perfectly natural that I, as an anti-Semitic person and as I
saw the Jewish question, was in no way interested in that. Perhaps
I did not see the good traits which you or some others see
in the Jews. That is possible. But at any rate I was not interested
in investigating as to what particular good qualities might be recognized
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This would seem a good time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you visit concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. I visited the Dachau Concentration Camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: When was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I believe the first time was when all the Gauleiter
were called together. I believe 1935, I do not know definitely, 1934
or 1935, I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: At what intervals did you then visit this camp?
It is said that you were in Dachau every 4 weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Altogether I was at Dachau four times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: It is asserted that after each of your visits in
Dachau, Jews disappeared there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know whether Jews disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What caused you to visit the Dachau Camp repeatedly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I went to the Dachau Camp to visit Social Democratic
and Communist functionaries from my Gau who were in
prison there to have them introduced to me. I picked out—I do not
know how many hundreds of them there were—but every time I
was in Dachau I picked out 10 or 20 of those of whom it had been
ascertained by the Police that they had no criminal record; I had
them picked out from among the inmates, and at Christmas every
year I had them brought in buses to Nuremberg to the Hotel
Deutscher Hof, where I brought them together with their wives
and children and had dinner with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to ask the Tribunal, for the benefit of the Nuremberg
public, to permit me to make a very short statement as to
why I took these Communists out. Party proceedings were initiated
against me because I did this. There were rumors which were not
true. May I make a very short statement as to why I did it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I should like to ask the Tribunal to approve this,
Mr. President, so that the reasons why the defendant did this may
be ascertained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, as long as it is brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: When I walked through the streets of Nuremberg
children approached me and said, “My father is in Dachau.” Women
came to me and asked to get their husbands back. I knew many
of these officials from the time when I spoke at revolutionary
meetings, and I could vouch for these people. I know of only one
case where I was wrong in the selection of those people. All the
others behaved impeccably. They kept the word which they had
given me. Thus, perhaps my Party comrades, who sit here in the
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
dock, see now that I did not want to harm my country but that
I wanted to do, and did do, something humanely good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Now I come to the picture books which appeared
in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> publishing house. You know that two picture
books were published, one with the title, <span class='it'>Trust No Fox in the Field</span>,
and the other one with the title, <span class='it'>The Poisonous Toadstool</span>. Do
you assume responsibility for these picture books?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes. May I say, by way of summary, that I
assume responsibility for everything which was written by my
assistants or which came into my publishing house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Who was the author of these picture books?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The book <span class='it'>Trust No Fox in the Field</span> and <span class='it'>No Jew
Under His Oath</span> was done and illustrated by a young woman artist,
and she also wrote the text. The title which appears on the picture
book is from Dr. Martin Luther.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second picture book was done by the Editor-in-Chief of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, who was a former schoolteacher. Two criminal cases
in Nuremberg, which were tried here in this courtroom, as far as I
know, were the occasion for my publishing these two books. There
was a manufacturer, Louis Schloss, a Jew, who with young Nuremberg
girls some of them still innocent, had...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, we do not want to hear that now.
My question was only as to who was the author of these picture
books and whether you assumed the responsibility for them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: It is important for the Tribunal, in fact, right for
them to know how it came about that all of a sudden two picture
books for young people appeared in my publishing house. I am
making this statement absolutely objectively. I am speaking here
of legal cases. There are gentlemen here, who are witnesses, who
were here in this court and were present during the proceedings.
Only thus can one understand why these books were published.
They were the answer to deeds that had occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, but we are concerned here only with the accusation
made against you, that thereby you exerted an influence on
the minds of young people which was not beneficial and which
could be considered designed to have a poisonous effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: And I should like to prove by my statement that
we wanted to protect youth because things had, in fact, occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, but young persons could hardly understand
the Schloss case, or any such case, could they?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: It was a matter of public discussion in Nuremberg
and beyond that all over Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: As far as I am concerned, this question is answered,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: But not for me as defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You told us that the books were published
to answer things which had occurred here. That is sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, another serious accusation made by the
Prosecution against you is that a special issue concerning ritual
murders was published in the publishing house of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
and appeared in one number of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. How did this special
issue come about and what was the cause for it? Were you the
author of that special issue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Who was the author?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: My collaborator, the Editor-in-Chief at that time,
Karl Holz, who is now dead. But I assume the responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it not true that even during the twenties you
dealt with that question in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, and in public speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, in public speeches. Why did you now in 1935
stir up again this doubtlessly very grave matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I should like to ask my counsel to express no
judgment as to what I have written; to question me, but not to
express judgment. The Prosecution are going to do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have asked me how this issue came about. I will explain
very briefly...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me, Mr. President. I have to protest against
the fact that Herr Streicher here, in the course of his interrogation
by me, thinks he can criticize the manner in which I put my
questions. Therefore, I ask the Court to give a decision on this,
since otherwise I am not in a position to ask my questions at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have already stated your position and
the Tribunal has given you full support in your position. Will you
please continue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And let me tell you this, Defendant, that if you are insolent
either to your counsel or to the Tribunal, the Tribunal will not
be able to continue the hearing of your case at this moment. You
will kindly treat your counsel and the Tribunal with due courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: May I ask to say something about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No. Answer the question, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I will go on now with my questioning.
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution accuse you, in connection with this ritual
murder affair, of having treated the matter without documentary
proof, by referring to a story from the Middle Ages. What, in brief,
was your source?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The sources were given in that issue. Nothing
was written without the sources being given at the same time.
There was reference made to a book written in Greek by a former
Rabbi who had been converted to Christianity. There was reference
made to a publication of a high clergymen of Milan, a book
which has appeared in Germany for the last 50 years. Not even
under the democratic government did Jews raise objections to that
book. That ritual murder issue refers to court files which are
located in Rome, it refers to files which are in Court. There are
pictures in it which show that in 23 cases the Church itself has
dealt with this question. The Church has canonized 23 non-Jews
killed by ritual murder. Pictures of sculptures, that is, of stone
monuments were shown as illustrations; everywhere the source was
pointed out; even a case in England was mentioned, and one in
Kiev, Russia. But in this connection I should like to say, as I said
to a Jewish officer here, that we never wanted to assert that all
Jewry was ready now to commit ritual murders. But it is a fact
that within Jewry there exists a sect which engaged in these
murders, and has done so up until the present. I have asked my
counsel to submit to the Court a file from Pisek in Czechoslovakia,
very recent proceedings. A court of appeal has confirmed a case of
ritual murder. Thus, in conclusion I must say...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I object to this statement, Your
Honor. After his counsel has refused to submit it, he insists on
stating here the contents of a court record. Now this is not an
orderly way to make charges against the Jewish people. Streicher
says he is asking counsel to submit. His counsel apparently has
refused, whereupon he starts to give evidence of what he knows,
in any case, is a resumé of the matters which his counsel has
declined to submit here. It seems to me that, having appointed
counsel to conduct his case, he has shown repeatedly that he is not
willing to conduct his case in an orderly manner and he ought to
be returned to his cell and any further statements that he wishes
to make to this Court transmitted through his counsel in writing.
This is entirely unfair and in contempt of Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, I think you had better continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I should like to say that that closes this affair.
The essential thing is whether one can say that he treated the case
without documentary proof. The Defense is not interested in the
affair at all; and, according to my recollection, I even suggested to
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
one of the gentlemen of the Prosecution that this affair perhaps be
left out altogether, because it is really so gruesome and so horrible
that it is better not to treat it. But the defendant only wanted to
say that it was only on the basis of various pieces of evidence that
he dealt with the case, and I believe that is sufficient; that should
close the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Herr Streicher, you fall again and again into the mistake
of going too far in your explanations and of discussing things which
can be considered propaganda on your part. I should like to ask
you now for the last time to stick to the questions and leave out
everything else. It is in your own interest. You are accused of
having carried on various activities in your Gau, which were
Crimes Against Humanity, of having mistreated people who lived
in your Gau. Thus you are accused of having sought out a political
prisoner, a certain Steinruck, in his cell and of having beaten him.
Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was Steinruck a Jew?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: For what reason did you do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Steinruck, in a public place, in the presence of
many witnesses, had made derogatory statements about the Führer,
libelous statements. He was at police headquarters. I had spoken
to the Police President about it and told him that I should like to
look at that Steinruck once. I went with my adjutant—the Göring
report says that a Party member, Holz, was there too, but that is
not correct—I went with my adjutant to police headquarters. The
same Police President, who later denounced me to Reich Marshal
Göring, took me to Steinruck’s cell. We went into the cell; I stated
here that I had come with the intention of talking to him, talking
to him reasonably. We talked to him. But he behaved so cowardly
that it became necessary at the moment that he be chastised. I
do not mind stating here that I am sorry about that case, that I
regret it as a slip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then it is asserted that in August 1938 you beat
up an editor, Burger. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No, that is not correct. If I had beaten him up,
then I would say so here. But I believe that my adjutant and
somebody else had an argument with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What about the incident in the Künstlerhaus in
Munich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I went to Munich to the Inn Künstlerstätte, or
something like that. I was received by the manager. Then a young
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
man came up to me, drunk and quarrelsome, and shouted at me.
The manager protested and ordered him out of the place. But the
drunken young fellow came back again and again and then my
chauffeur grabbed him and my son helped. They took him into a
room and beat him up and then the proprietor of the inn thanked
me for having rid him of the drunkard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I should like to have the Tribunal’s permission to state
very briefly my position on one case which I believe the Prosecution
also have dropped, where I was accused of sadistic tendencies...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Defendant, you know perfectly well that
that incident has been stricken from the record and is not, therefore,
mentioned against you, so that it is quite unnecessary to go
into it. The Tribunal cannot hear you on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, from the so-called Göring report I should
like to submit to you some points which have been presented by
the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You know that after the action of November 1938, in the district
of Franconia, Aryanization of Jewish property was undertaken to
the utmost extent. Would you like to make a statement about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Here in the Göring report is a reference to a
statement of the deceased Party member, Holz. In that statement
it is pointed out that Holz came to see me after that action, that
he made a report about the action and likewise declared the action
to be wrong; he said furthermore that now that this had happened,
he considered it necessary to go further and Aryanize the property.
The Göring report states that I then told Holz that could not be done
and that I opposed it. Then it states further that Holz said to me
that he still thought it would be right if one were to do it. We
could then get out of it the means for the establishment of a Gau
school. Holz also states that I said something like: “Well, Holz, if
you believe you can do it, then go ahead and do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to state here that what Party member Holz said is true.
I was opposed at first; and then, acting on a sudden impulse, which
I cannot understand today, I said, “Well, if you can do it, then go
ahead and do it.” I want to state that at that time when I said
it, I did not believe at all that it was to be done or would be done;
but it was done. The Reich Marshal, as Delegate for the Four Year
Plan, later stated his position on it in Berlin, sharply rejecting it.
Only at that time did I find out exactly how Holz accomplished this
Aryanization. I had a talk with him, got into a serious dispute;
and our friendly relations were broken off at that time. Holz
volunteered in an armored unit, went to the front, and resigned
as deputy. I returned from Berlin to Nuremberg, and later there
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
appeared in Nuremberg a Police Inspector sent by the Reich
Marshal in his capacity as Delegate for the Four Year Plan. He
reported to me and asked me if I would agree to an investigation of
the whole matter, and I stated that I would welcome the investigation.
Then the investigation took place. The Aryanization was
repealed, and it was established that Holz personally had not gotten
any material advantage from it. Aryanization was then taken over
by the State, repealed, and taken over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I state frankly that in that affair I am at least guilty of
negligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you know that the amounts paid in the Aryanization
of houses or real estate represented only about 20 percent, or
even less, of the actual value?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Holz had not come to see me for weeks. He had
carried on the Aryanization in the Labor Front Office with the
expert there. Not until later, in Berlin during the meeting which
the Reich Marshal held, did I learn of the real facts; and thus the
dispute and the break between Holz and me came about, because
I had to disapprove the manner in which the Aryanization had been
handled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You are further accused of having had shares in the
Mars Works at Nuremberg acquired at an extraordinarily low
price, for purposes of enriching yourself and, in the course of this
acquisition, of having exerted an undue pressure on the owner of
the shares?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: It says in the Göring report, literally, that I had
instructed and in another place that I had given the order that the
Mars shares be acquired for me. I state here that I neither instructed
nor ordered anyone to acquire the Mars shares. The whole
thing was like this. The director of my publishing house, who had
power of attorney because I, personally, never in all the years
bothered with financial or business matters, could do what he
wanted. One day he came to see me with my adjutant. I do not
recollect now whether the adjutant or the director of my publishing
house was the one who spoke first. I was told the following:
An attorney had called and said that the Mars shares were being
offered for sale at an advantageous price. The director of my
publishing house asked me whether I agreed. I stated that never
in my life had I owned any shares, that I had never bothered
about financial matters in my publishing house. If he thought that
the stock should be bought, then he could do it. The shares were
bought. It was the most serious breach of confidence ever committed
against me by any Party comrade or employee. After a
short time it turned out; that is, I was informed how these shares
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
had been acquired. I found out that the owner had been threatened.
When I found out under what conditions this stock purchase had
been made, I gave the order at once to return the stock. In the
Göring report it is noted that this return took place. Among the
confiscated files of my publishing house there is an official statement
about this affair which shows that these shares were returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection perhaps I may be permitted to say that my
publishing house was located until the end of the war in a rented
house. At the time of the Aryanization I was approached with the
plan that an Aryanized house be acquired for my publishing firm.
I refused that. I state here in conclusion that I have in my possession
no Jewish property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When those demonstrations occurred in 1938, jewels had been
brought into the Gau house. These pieces of jewelry were turned
over to the police. A man who was bearer of the honorary Party
emblem was convicted and sentenced to 6 years penal servitude
because he had given his sweetheart a ring and another piece of
jewelry dating from that time. But I may add one thing: The guilt
of this bearer of the Party emblem rests perhaps with those who
gave the order: “Go into the Jewish houses.” That man, as far as
I knew him, had always been personally decent. Because of that
order, he got into a position in which he committed a crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have finished what I wanted to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it not true the allegations, made by the chief
of the publishing firm Fink before the Party Court and also even
before that, at a police interrogation, were different, in the main
points, from your present statements?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The whole thing was that Fink, the publishing
house manager, was called to police headquarters and interrogated.
The police Chief was interested in the hearing since for many years
he had been a friend of mine and of my family. Fink returned
from the interrogation completely upset. He paced up and down
in front of me and shouted, “I was threatened, I have made statements
which are not true. I am blackguard. I am a criminal.”
A witness of that incident was my chauffeur. I calmed him down
and told him, “I was called in for a hearing once, too. I was even
imprisoned once. I will give you opportunity...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it necessary to go into such detail in this
matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me, Mr. President. Perhaps this is necessary,
because in this very report reference is made to the testimony of
Fink; and an attempt is made to prove with this that the explanation
made by the Defendant Streicher is wrong, that he gave the
order to purchase this stock, possibly under pressure, and that he
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
approved of it, whereas he counters that he knew neither that these
shares were to be bought at such a low price nor that blackmail
was to be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this is taken for granted, then, of course, we can close the
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is what he has already said. He has
said that quite clearly, has he not? I was only suggesting that it
was not necessary to go into such detail in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, it may be of some importance to state
what the development of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> has been since 1933, as far
as circulation is concerned. Give us a short statement on the
circulation of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, and then I shall put another question
to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> appeared in 1923 in octavo format,
and in the beginning it had a circulation of 2,000 to 3,000 copies.
In the course of time the circulation increased to 10,000. At that
time <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> circulated—until 1933 really—only in Nuremberg,
in my Gau, perhaps also in Southern Bavaria. The publisher
was a bookseller and he worked first with one man, then with two.
This is proof that the circulation was really small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1933—but I say this with certain reservations because it may
be that the publisher did not always tell me the correct circulation
figures and I had no written contract with him—I say with reservations,
that in 1933 the circulation was 25,000 copies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1935 the publisher died; and at that time it was, I believe,
40,000. Then an expert took over the publishing house and organized
it to cover all of Germany. The circulation increased then to
100,000, and went up as high as 600,000. It fluctuated, decreased,
and then dropped during the war; I cannot say exactly but I believe
it was about 150,000 to 200,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You said that that new man organized the circulation
to cover all of Germany. Was the Party machinery utilized in
this, and were not industries and other offices—the German Labor
Front, for instance—utilized in order to increase the circulation
forcibly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Well, the attitude of the Party was made manifest
in a letter, which was sent to all Gaue, signed by Bormann. There
it was expressly pointed out that <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> was not a Party organ
and had nothing to do with the Party. Thereupon several Gauleiter
saw this an occasion for ordering that <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> should not
appear in their Gaue any more. Now it is clear that within the
organizations there were Party members who, because of idealism
or for other reasons, worked to increase the distribution of <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span>. However, I myself, neither in writing nor orally, ever
issued any order to any Party organization to support <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher, even, before 1933 you came in contact
with the courts on various occasions, both because of your
articles and because of your attitude as evidenced in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
Would you give us a short statement as to how often that occurred
and what consequences it had for you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: How often? I cannot answer that exactly now, but
it was very often. I was frequently given a court summons. You
ask me about the consequences. I was many times in prison, but
I can say proudly that in the sentences it repeatedly stated “an incorruptible
fanatic for the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the consequence of my activity as a speaker and
writer, but perhaps it is important to add the following: I never
was arraigned because of criminal charges, but only because of my
anti-Semitic activity, and the charge was brought by an organization
of citizens of the Jewish faith. The chairman filed charges
repeatedly when we made a slip in speaking and thus exposed
ourselves to prosecution on the basis of the laws and regulations
existing at that time. But perhaps I may also point out here that
the Jewish Justizrat, Dr. Süssheim, the Prosecuting Attorney,
stated before the court here in this courtroom, “Your Honors, he
is our inexorable enemy, but he is a fanatic for the truth. He is
convinced of what he does; he is honest about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What years were they that you were repeatedly
in jail?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That was, of course, before 1933. The first time I
went to Landsberg, to prison, because I had taken part in the Hitler
Putsch. Then I was sentenced to three and a half months in prison
in Nuremberg, where I am now. Then I got three months...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You needn’t bother with the details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is to say, before 1933 I was repeatedly given
prison sentences or fined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, the Göring report also mentions the
fact that the Defendant Streicher was personally interested in
various Jewish plants, allegedly in order to get some capital out
of them. However, I am of the opinion that it is not essential to
deal with these points. The same applies to the fact that the house
on Lake of Constance was sold, and to whom. I do not know
whether the defendant should make any statements about this here.
In my opinion there is no cause to ask him any questions concerning
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you could leave that and see whether
it is taken up in cross-examination. If it is, then you may re-examine
him.
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this concludes my questions to the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any members of defendants’ counsel wish
to ask questions of the defendant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LIEUTENANT COLONEL J. M. G. GRIFFITH-JONES (Junior
Counsel for the United Kingdom): If the Tribunal pleases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When you handed over your Party to Hitler in 1922, did you
know his policy and what was to become the policy of the Nazi
Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The policy? First I should like to say, “no.” At
that time one could not speak of things which could not exist even
as thoughts. The policy then was to create a new faith for the
German people, that is, a faith which would deny the chaos and
disorder and which would bring about a return to order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: May I take it that, within a short
course of time, you knew the policy, the policy according to the
Party program and according to <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I did not need a Party program. I admit frankly
that I never read it in its entirety. At that time programs were
not important, but mass meetings...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That’s not an answer to the question. The
question was whether, a short time after 1922, you knew the policy
as indicated in the Party program and in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You knew, did you not, that the
policy included the Anschluss with Austria? Can you answer that
“yes” or “no”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No. There was never any talk about Austria. I
do not remember that the Führer ever spoke about the fact that
Austria should be annexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I only want you to answer my
question. My question was: Did you know that the Führer’s policy
was the annexation of Austria to Germany? I understand your
answer to be “no.” Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That he intended it? No, that I did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Did you know that he intended to
take over Czechoslovakia or at least the Sudetenland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Did you know that from the beginning
in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> his ultimate objective was Lebensraum?
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: What I read in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> is marked in red.
The book has been confiscated. I only read that. I read only what
concerns the Jewish question; I did not read anything else. However,
that we had the objective of acquiring Lebensraum for our
people, that goes without saying. I personally also had set myself
the objective of contributing in some way to providing a future for
the surplus children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. May I take it that
during the years 1922 and 1923, as editor and owner of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>,
and as a Gauleiter from 1925, you did everything you could to put
the Nazi Party into power?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes; that is to be taken as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: And after 1933 did you continuously
support and issue propaganda on behalf of the Nazi Party’s
policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Not only in respect to the Jewish
question, but to the foreign policy as well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No, that is not correct. In <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> there is
not a single article to be found which dealt with foreign policy.
I devoted myself exclusively...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: That is quite enough. I am not
going to occupy very much time with this matter. But I would ask
you to look at Document Number D-802.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this is a new exhibit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which will be what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Exhibit Number GB-327.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I am sorry, but the document seems to be missing for
the moment. Perhaps I might read the extract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Let me just read to you an extract
from an article which you wrote in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of March 1938, immediately
after the Anschluss with Austria. I want you to tell me
whether or not you are advocating the Nazi policy in regard to
Austria.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Our Lord is making provision that the power of the Jews
may not extend to heaven itself. What was only a dream
up to a few days ago has now become reality. The brother
nation of Austria has returned home to the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then, a few lines farther down:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We are entering into glorious times, a Greater Germany
without Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you say that you are not there issuing propaganda on behalf
of the Nazi policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I did not indulge in propaganda politics, for
Austria was already annexed. I just welcomed the fact. I did not
need to make any more propaganda about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. Perhaps you’ll tell
me what you mean by the “Greater Germany” that you are approaching.
What Greater Germany are you approaching in March
1938, a Germany greater than it was after the Anschluss with
Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: A Greater Germany, a living area in which all
Germans, German-speaking people, people of German blood, can
live together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Do I understand that you are advocating
Lebensraum, greater space, not yet owned by Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Not at first, no. At first it was merely a question
of Austria and Germany. The Austrians are Germans and, therefore,
belong to a Greater Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I won’t argue with you. I will
just ask you once more, what do you mean by the “Greater Germany”
that you are approaching in March of 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have already explained, a Germany where all
those can live and work together who speak German and have
German blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Would you look at Document
Number D-818, which will become Exhibit Number GB-328. Perhaps
I can carry on. In November of 1938, after Munich, did you
yourself personally send a telegram to Konrad Henlein, the leader
of the Sudeten-German Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: If it says so here, then it is true. I do not recall it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Let me refresh your recollection
as to what you said, “Without your courageous preparatory work
the great task would not have succeeded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are you there advocating and issuing propaganda in support of
the policy of the Nazi Government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have to ask you again, would you please repeat
your question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am asking you whether or not
that telegram, which you sent to Konrad Henlein and reprinted in
your newspaper under a picture of that gentleman—I am asking
you whether or not that was propaganda in support of the Nazi
policy, Nazi foreign policy?
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have to say the same to this as I said before.
That was a telegram of greeting, of thanks. I did not have to make
propaganda any more because the Munich Agreement had already
taken place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I put it to you and I’ll leave it.
I’ll put it to you that throughout the years from 1933 until 1944 or
1945 you were in fact doing everything you could to support the
policy of the Government, both domestically and in regard to its
foreign affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: As far as possible within my field of activity, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I want to turn now to the question
of the Jews. May I remind you of the speech that you made
on 1 April 1933, that is to say, the day of the boycott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this will be found in the original document book,
Document Number M-33. It was not actually put in before. It
now becomes Exhibit Number GB-329. It is in the document book
on Page 15, in the original document book which the Tribunal have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now, I give you the document book.
If you want to see the original, you may do so in every case.
[<span class='it'>The document book was submitted to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“For 14 years we have been crying to the German nation,
‘German people, learn to recognize your true enemy,’ and
14 years ago the German Philistines listened and then declared
that we preached religious hatred. Today German
people have awakened; even all over the world there is talk
of the eternal Jews. Never since the beginning of the world
and the creation of man has there been a nation which
dared to fight against the nation of blood-suckers and extortioners
who, for a thousand years, have spread all over the
world.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then I go down to the last line of the next paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It was left to our Movement to expose the eternal Jew as
a mass murderer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is it right that for 14 years you had been repeating in Germany,
“German people, learn to recognize your true enemy”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I state first of all that what you have given me
here has nothing to do with that. You have given me an article...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are asked a question. You are asked
whether it is true that for 14 years you had been repeating,
to Germany, “Learn to recognize your true enemy.” Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: And in doing so, is it true that
you had been preaching religious hatred?
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Will you look at...</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: May I be permitted to make a statement concerning
this answer? In my weekly, <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, I repeatedly
stated that for me the Jews are not a religious group but a race, a
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: And do you think to call them
“blood-suckers,” “a nation of blood-suckers and extortioners”—do
you think that’s preaching hatred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I beg your pardon. I have not understood you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You may call them a race or a
nation, whichever you like, now; but you were saying, on 1 April
1933, that they were a “nation of blood-suckers and extortioners.”
Do you call that preaching hatred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is a statement, the expression of a conviction
which can be proved on the basis of historical facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Understand me. I did not ask you
whether it was a fact or not. I am asking whether you called it
preaching hatred. Your answer is “yes” or “no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No, it is not preaching hatred; it is just a statement
of facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Will you look two pages further
on in that last document, M-33, and do you see the fourth paragraph
from the end of the extract? That is Page 17 of the document
book: “As long as I stand at the head of the struggle, this struggle
will be conducted so honestly that the eternal Jew will derive no
joy from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That I wrote; that was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: And you were, were you not, one
of those who did stand and continue to stand at the head of that
struggle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Did I stand at the head? I am too modest a man
for that. But I do claim to have declared my conviction and my
knowledge clearly and unmistakably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Why did you say that so long as
you were at the head of it, the Jew would derive no joy from it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Because I considered myself a man whom destiny
had placed in a position to enlighten people on the Jewish question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: And “enlightenment”—is that another
word for persecution? Do you mean by “enlightenment,”
“persecution”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I did not understand that.
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Do you mean by “enlightenment”
the word “persecution”? Is that why the Jew was to have no joy
from it, from your enlightenment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I ask to have the question repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I can show it to you and we will
repeat the question as loud as you want it. Do you mean by
“enlightenment” the word “persecution”? Do you hear that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I hear “enlightenment” and “production.” I mean
by “enlightenment” telling another person something which he does
not yet know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: We won’t go on with that. You
know, do you not, that starting with the boycott which you led
yourself in 1933, the Jews thereafter were, during the course of
the years, deprived of the right to vote, deprived of holding any
public office, excluded from the professions; demonstrations were
conducted against them in 1938, they were fined a billion marks
after that, they were forced to wear a yellow star, they had their
own separate seats to sit on, and they had their houses and their
businesses taken away from them. Do you call that “enlightenment”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That has nothing to do with what I wrote, nothing
to do with it. I did not issue the orders. I did not make the laws.
I was not asked when laws were prepared. I had nothing to do
with these laws and orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: But as those laws and orders were
passed you were applauding them, and you were going on abusing
the Jews and asking for more and more orders to be passed; isn’t
that a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I ask to have put to me which law I applauded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Now, you told the Tribunal yesterday,
did you not, that you were responsible, you thought, for the
Nuremberg Decrees, which you had been advocating for years
before they came into force; isn’t that a fact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The Nuremberg Decrees? I did not make them.
I was not asked beforehand, and I did not sign them either. But
I state here that these laws are the same laws which the Jewish
people have as their own. It is the greatest and most important
act of legislation which a modern nation has at any time made
for its protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think that is the time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for
the United Kingdom): My Lord, I wonder if the Tribunal would be
good enough to consider setting aside a half hour some time for
the discussion of the documents of the Defendant Von Schirach.
We are ready to clear up outstanding points at any time that is
suitable to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now,
I just want to ask you a few questions as to the part you played
in the various actions against the Jews between 1933 and 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you look at Document M-6, which is at Page 20 in the
document book that you have before you, Page 22 in the document
book that the Tribunal have in English. It is Page 20 in the German
document book; M-6, which is already Exhibit Number GB-170.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I just want to refer to what you said about the Nuremberg
Decrees. You told us this morning that you thought when
they had been passed that that was already the final solution of the
Jewish question. Will you look at the paragraph beginning in the
center of the page, “However, to those who believe...”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“However, to those who believe that the Jewish question has
been finally solved and the matter thus settled for Germany
by the Nuremberg Decrees, be it said that the battle continues—world
Jewry itself is seeing to that anyhow—and we
shall only get through this battle victoriously if every member
of the German people knows that his very existence is at stake.
The work of enlightenment carried on by the Party seems to
me to be more necessary than ever today, even though many
Party members seem to think that these matters are no
longer real or urgent.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, I wrote that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: What do you mean by saying “the
battle continues,” if you have already solved the Jewish problem
by the issuance of the Nuremberg Decrees?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have already stated today that the solution of the
Jewish problem was regarded by me as having to be solved, first
of all, within the country and then in conjunction with other nations.
Thus “the battle continues” means that in the International Anti-Semitic
Union, which I had formed and which had representatives
from all countries in it, the question was discussed as to what could
be done from an international point of view to terminate the Jewish
problem.
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Are we, therefore, to take it that
everything that you said and wrote after 1936 was in connection
with an international problem and had nothing to do with the Jews
in Germany as such?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, mainly international, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Let me just refer you to half way
through the next paragraph, “<span class='it'>Der Stürmer’s</span> 15 years’ work of
enlightenment has already led an army of those who know, millions
strong, to National Socialism.” Is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You see, you were telling the
Tribunal this morning that up to 1933, and indeed afterwards, you
said the circulation of your paper was only very small. Is it true,
in fact, that your 15 years’ work had led an army, millions strong,
to National Socialism?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have said today that the moment the press was
politically co-ordinated, 3,000 daily newspapers were committed to
the purpose of enlightenment about the Jewish problem. There were
3,000 daily papers in addition to <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. I don’t think you need
go on. Let me just finish reading through that paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The continued work of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> will help to insure that
down to the last man every German will, with heart and
hand, join the ranks of those whose aim it is to crush the
head of the serpent Pan-Judah.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Wait one moment, let me ask my question. There is nothing
there about an international problem. You are addressing yourself
to the German people, are you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: In that article? Yes. And if that article was read
abroad, then also to countries abroad, but as to the remark about
crushing the serpent’s head, that is a biblical expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Will you now let us discuss for a
moment the breaking up of the synagogue in Nuremberg, which
you have told about, on the 10th of August of 1938. Will you look
at Page 41 of the book that you have in front of you, Page 42 of the
English document book that the Tribunal has.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we have heard your explanation of that breaking up of the
synagogue. The <span class='it'>Fränkische Tageszeitung</span> at the 11th of August
states this, “In Nuremberg the synagogue is being demolished.
Julius Streicher himself inaugurated this work by a speech lasting
more than an hour and a half.” Were you talking to the inhabitants
of Nuremberg upon the architectural value of their city for an hour
and a half on the 10th of August 1938?
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I no longer know in detail what I said, but I refer
to what you have remarked and what you find important. There
was a branch of the Propaganda Ministry in Nuremberg. The young
Regierungsrat had press conferences with the editors every day,
and at that time he told the editors during a press conference that
Streicher would speak and that the synagogue was being demolished
and that this was to be kept secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I asked you, were you talking for
that hour and a half on the architectural beauties of Nuremberg
and not against the Jews? Is that what you are telling us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That, too, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: At the press conference to which
you referred—you no doubt have seen the document; it is Page 40
of the Tribunal’s document book—do you remember that it was
arranged that the show should be staged in a big way, the show of
pulling down the synagogue? What was the object of arranging the
demonstration to demolish that synagogue in such a big way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I was merely the speaker. What you are intimating
here, that was done by the representative of the Ministry of Propaganda;
but I would not object to it if you decided to assume, let
me put it like that, that I would naturally have been in favor of
making a big show if I had been asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Let me just ask you now a word
about the demonstrations which followed that in November of that
year—My Lord, I refer to Page 43 of the document book; 42 of the
German—as I understand it, you tell us that you disapproved of
those demonstrations that took place and they took place without
your knowledge or previous knowledge. Is that correct, “yes” or “no”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, it is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I just want to remind you of what
you said on the following day, the 10th of November. This is an
account of what happened:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In Nuremberg and Fürth there were demonstrations by the
crowd against the Jewish gang of murderers. These lasted
until the early hours of the morning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I now pass to the end of that paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After midnight the excitement of the public had reached its
peak and a large crowd marched to the synagogues in Nuremberg
and Fürth and burned those two Jewish buildings where
the murder of Germans had been preached.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is now what you say—it is on Page 44 of the document
book, My Lord:
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“From the cradle on, the Jew is not taught as we are: ‘Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself’ or ‘If you are smitten on
the left cheek offer then your right one.’ No. He is told ‘With
the non-Jew you can do whatever you like.’ He is even taught
that the slaughtering of a non-Jew is an act pleasing to God.
For 20 years we have been writing about this in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
For 20 years we have been preaching it throughout the world,
and we have made millions recognize the truth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Does that sound as though you had disapproved of the demonstrations
that had taken place the night before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: First of all I must state that the report, part of
which you read, appeared in a daily paper. Thus I am not to be
held responsible for this. If someone wrote that part of the populace
rose up against the gang of murderers then that is in keeping with
the order from the Ministry of Propaganda in Berlin; outwardly
that action was described as a spontaneous demonstration of the
populace...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: That does not answer my question.
Does that passage that I have read sound as though you had
disapproved of the demonstrations that had taken place the night
before? Does it or does it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I was against that demonstration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Just let me read on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“But we know that we have in our midst people who take
pity on the Jews, people who are not worthy of living in this
town, who are not worthy of belonging to this people, of
whom you are a proud part.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Why should it have been necessary for people to have had pity
on the Jews, if you were not—you and the Nazi Party—persecuting
them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have already pointed out today that I was forced,
after this demonstration had taken place, to make a public comment
and say that one should not have so much pity. I wanted to prove
thereby that this was not a spontaneous action by the people; in
other words, the matter does not speak against me; it speaks for
me. The people, as I myself, were opposed to the demonstration and
I found that I had cause to—should I say—get public opinion to the
point where one might possibly not regard that action as something
too severe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: But, why, if you were opposed to
it and if the people were opposed to it, should it have been your
duty to try and convert them so that they should be in favor of that
kind of thing? Why were you opposed to it and why should you
try to turn them against the Jew?
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not understand what you mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I understand you to say that you
were opposed to these demonstrations and that the people also were
opposed to the demonstrations; that, therefore, it was your duty to
try to stir them up and make them in favor of the demonstrations
after they had happened. Why should it have been your duty to do
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Today one can perhaps say that this or that was
my duty, but one must consider what those times were—the confusion
that existed—that to make a quick decision, as one might
have to in this courtroom, was quite impossible. What happened
has happened. I was against it and the public too. What was written
about it otherwise was done so for tactical reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. Were you in favor of
the Aryanization of Jewish houses and businesses? Were you in
favor of that or did you disapprove of that issue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have answered that question today in great
detail, in connection with a statement of Party comrade Holz. I
have stated and I repeat that my deputy came to me...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Just stop for a moment, I don’t
want a speech. I asked you a question which you could answer
“yes” or “no.” Did you approve or disapprove of the system of
Aryanization of Jewish businesses and houses?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: One cannot answer that quickly with “yes” or
“no.” I have made it clear today, and you must allow me to explain
it so that there is not any misunderstanding. My Party comrade...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am not going to allow you to
repeat it. I will go on if you are not prepared to answer that
question. The Tribunal have heard it and I pass on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I certainly want to answer it. After my Party
comrades...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Defendant...</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: After the Party comrades came...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have refused to answer the question
properly, a question to which you can give either an affirmative or
a negative answer. Did you approve or did you not approve? You
can give an answer to that and then you can give any explanation
afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I personally was not for Aryanization. When
Holz repeated that, giving as a reason that the houses had been
pretty badly damaged, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, that we might get material for a
Gau (district) building, I said “All right, if you can do it, go ahead.”
I already stated today that this was carelessness on my part.
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: There were in fact a very great
number of Jewish businesses and houses Aryanized in Nuremberg
and Franconia, were there not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Would you just look at a new
exhibit, Document Number D-835, which becomes Exhibit GB-330.
That is a list—it is an original document—it is a list of Jewish
property in Nuremberg and Fürth which was Aryanized. Have you
seen that list or anything like it before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, you can take it from me,
that that list contains the addresses of some 800 properties in
Nuremberg and Fürth which have been taken from the Jews and
handed over to Aryans. Would you agree that that would be at least
800 houses in your city here that were Aryanized?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know about it in detail; but I must
establish something: I do not know—is that the official document?
I have already stated today that my Party comrade Holz started
Aryanizing. That was rescinded by Berlin. Then came the Aryanization
carried out by the State. I could not have had any influence
here, either, so that this was none of my business. This Aryanization,
the expropriation of Jewish property, was ordered by Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Now, you mentioned this morning
that you were a subscriber to a weekly newspaper called the
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: When did you start subscribing to
that newspaper?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: What did you say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: At what date did you start subscribing
to that newspaper?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, I have no doubt you can tell
the Tribunal approximately. Have you always, since 1933, been a
subscriber of that newspaper?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Well, I do not think I could have read every issue,
since I traveled a great deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You were, as I think it is stated in
this application of your wife to give evidence, a regular reader of
it, were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: My friends, the editors, and I used to share in the
reading of this paper.
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: May I take it that between yourself
and your editors—I don’t say every copy was read—but it was
regularly read from 1933 onwards; is that fair?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: You cannot say “read regularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL, GRIFFITH-JONES: A large number of the copies that
you subscribed for, which came weekly to you, were they read by
yourself or by your editors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Now, I want to turn to something
else for a moment. I want to make myself perfectly clear to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, I should like to draw the attention of
the Tribunal to the fact that the document which has just been
presented, “Confiscated Property and Real Estate,” has the heading
“Aryanization Department for Real Estate, Nuremberg.” That
cannot mean anything except that this document comes from the
official department which was later set up for the confiscation of
such real estate. But by no means can this be a document to prove
that we are concerned here with the real estate Aryanized by Holz,
subsequent to 9 November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I accept that that may be so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I should like to ask, therefore, that the appropriate
correction be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: If I was mistaken in saying that
those properties had been Aryanized, I would be right then, would
I not, in saying that that list of properties was prepared by the
Aryanization Department in Nuremberg for the purpose of Aryanizing
them in the future? Would that be a fair statement to make?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I won’t pursue that matter any
further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to make myself quite clear to you in what I am suggesting.
I am suggesting that from 1939 onwards you set out to
incite the German people to murder and to accept the fact of the
murder of the Jewish race. Do you understand that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is not true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: No doubt you will say it isn’t true.
I just wanted you to be quite clear on what my suggestion is going
to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want you to look now at a bundle, which will be given to you,
of extracts from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. You can see the originals which are
in Court if you desire to do so, but it will save time if we use the
document books there.
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, will you look at Page 3-A. For convenience, the pages in
this bundle are all marked “A” to distinguish them from the numbers
in the original document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are they all in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: None of them are in evidence at
the moment. Perhaps the most convenient way would be for me to
put the actual documents in evidence together at the end, unless
the Tribunal or the defendant desire to see any copies of them. I
will give them numbers as I go along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you look at Page 3-A of that bundle, Document Number
D-809, which becomes Exhibit Number GB-331:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Jewish problem is not yet solved, nor will it be solved
when one day the last Jew will have left Germany. Only when
world Jewry has been annihilated, will it have been solved.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that what you were working for when you say you were
working for the international solution to this problem, an annihilation
of world Jewry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: If that is how you understand “annihilation.” That
was written by my chief editor at the time. He says that the Jewish
problem will not yet be solved when the last Jew will have left
Germany. And when he suddenly says that only when world Jewry
has been annihilated will it be solved, then he certainly may have
meant that the power of world Jewry should be annihilated. But
my Party comrade Holz did not think of mass killing or the possibility
of mass killing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: The German word used there is
“vernichtet,” is it not? Look at your copy. “Vernichtet” that means
“to annihilate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Today, when you look back, you could interpret it
like that, but not at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well, we won’t waste time
because we have quite a number to look through. Will you look on
to the next page. That was in January you were writing that. In
April 1939, Document D-810, Exhibit GB-332, I refer only to the last
two lines. This is an article again by your editor: “Then perhaps
their graves will proclaim that this murderous and criminal people
has, after all, met its deserved fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What do you mean by “graves” there? Do you mean excluding
them from the business of the world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: This is the first time that I have seen this article.
That is the statement of opinion of a man who was probably looking
ahead and making a play on words; but as far as I knew him, and
as far as we discussed the Jewish problem, there was no question
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
of mass extermination; we did not even think of it. Maybe it was
his wish—I do not know—but anyway, that is the way it happened
to be written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. Just turn over, will
you now, to May 1939, Document Number D-811, Exhibit Number
GB-333. I quote the last six lines: “There must be a punitive
expedition against the Jews in Russia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, of course, was before the Russian invasion.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“There must be a punitive expedition against the Jews in
Russia, a punitive expedition which will provide the same
fate for them that every murderer and criminal must expect,
death sentence and execution. The Jews in Russia must be
killed. They must be utterly exterminated. Then the world
will see that the end of the Jews is also the end of
Bolshevism.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Who wrote that article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: It is published in your <span class='it'>Stürmer</span>.
We can find out, if necessary. It is not written by you, but it is
published in your <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>; and you have told the Tribunal
that you accept responsibility for everything that was written in
that newspaper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: All right, I assume responsibility; but I want to
state that, here too, this is the private opinion of a man who in
May 1939 could not have thought that <span class='it'>ex nihilo</span>—for we had no
soldiers—a “March to Russia” could be started. This is a theoretic
and very strongly-worded expression of opinion of that anti-Semitic
person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: All I ask you about that is: Is that
not advocating the murder of Jews, that article; if it is not, what
is it advocating?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The whole article would have to be read so that I
could tell what motives existed for writing something like that. I
therefore ask you to make public the whole article. Then one can
form a proper judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, we’ll go on. We won’t waste
time unless you really want to see the whole article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, if I perhaps might be allowed to put these documents
in evidence. As Your Lordship will see, this bundle is a bundle of
extracts from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, with the permission of the Tribunal,
I would like to make the following statements: A number of extracts
from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> have been mentioned here which have
been put before me for the first time. Some of them are articles
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
which have not been written by the defendant personally. Some
are signed by Hiemer, and some by Holz, who was particularly
radical in his manner of writing, and passages are being quoted
which are perhaps taken out of context.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must ask, therefore, that I be afforded the opportunity of going
over these extracts together with the Defendant Streicher. Otherwise,
he might come to the conclusion that his defense is being
made too difficult for him and that it is being made impossible for
him to prepare himself appropriately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, you will have an opportunity of
checking up on these various extracts, and then you will be able
to introduce, if necessary, any passages which explain the extracts.
That is a matter which has been explained to defendants’ counsel
over and over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Griffith-Jones, are there not certain of these extracts
which are written or signed by the defendant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, with Your Lordship’s permission
I will refer to some of them, but so that I should not have
to refer to all of them, I was going to suggest that perhaps I might
put them in and, if it is necessary, let the Tribunal know afterwards
the numbers of them to save time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I put the whole bundle in evidence
and will not refer to all of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then you can give us the exhibit numbers
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: If that is suitable to the convenience
of the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well now, the Tribunal will see
by looking at this bundle, from the first page—which I think is
3-A—to Page 25-A, that there are various extracts which have been
written either by yourself or by members of your staff between
January 1939 and January 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do I understand you to say now, to have said in your evidence,
that you never knew that Jews were being exterminated in thousands
and millions in the Eastern territories? Did you never know
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: As I understood your evidence
about the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> this morning you said this, as
I have written it down:
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Sometimes that journal contained hints that everything was
not in order. Later in 1943 an article appeared stating that
masses of Jews were disappearing but the article did not
quote any figures and did not mention anything about
murders.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Are you really saying that those copies of the <span class='it'>Israelitisches
Wochenblatt</span>, which you and your editors were reading, contained
nothing except for a hint of disappearance with no mention of
figures or murder? Is that what you are telling this Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, I stick to that, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Now, I want you, if you will, to
take this bundle and keep it in front of you. It is a bundle of
extracts from the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> from July 1941 until
the end of the war. The Tribunal will be able to see what a fanatic
for the truth really tells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was submitted to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this bundle, for convenience again, is marked “B.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Will you look at the first page? That
is an article on the 11th of July 1941. “Some 40,000 Jews died in
Poland during the last years. The hospitals are overfull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, you need not turn over for the moment, Defendant. We
will turn the pages soon enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you happen to read that sentence in the issue of the 11th
of July 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Will you look at Page 3, 3-B? In
November 1941: “Very bad news comes from the Ukraine. Thousands
of Jewish dead are being mourned, among whom are many
of the Galician Jews who were expelled from Hungary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you read that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That might be possible. It says “thousands,”
thousands are being mourned. That is no proof that millions were
killed. There are no details as to how they came to their end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: If that is the explanation you want
us to accept we will leave it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just go on again to the next page, will you? The 12th of December
1941, a month later:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“According to news which has arrived from several sources,
thousands of Jews—one even speaks of many thousands—are
said to have been executed in Odessa”—and so on.—“Similar
reports reach us from Kiev and other Russian cities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you read that?
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know; and if I had read it then it would
not change a thing. That is no proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: But you have told the Tribunal,
you know, that there was nothing except hints of disappearance.
Doesn’t it show that you were not telling the truth when you read
these extracts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: In that case may I say the following? When the
war started we no longer received the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>.
During the later years one could only get the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>
through the Police. We got that paper, toward the end, into
Germany by smuggling. On one occasion we asked the Police to
provide us with foreign newspapers and this weekly, and we were
told that it was not possible. But we nevertheless got it. What
I mean to say by this is that I did not read every one of those
issues. The issues which I did read were confiscated on my farm.
Whatever is underlined has been read by me or it was read by my
editor in chief. I cannot, therefore, guarantee that I read every article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: No, I appreciate that and that is
why we have quite a number of them. You see, we have an extract
for practically every week or month over the course of 3 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would just like you to turn to Page 30-A of the “A” bundle.
I just want you to see what you were writing after having heard,
or after having read, or anyway after those copies of the <span class='it'>Israelitisches
Wochenblatt</span> had been published. This is a leading article
by yourself.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“If the danger of the reproduction of that curse of God in the
Jewish blood is finally to come to an end, then there is only
one way open—the extermination of that people whose father
is the devil.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And is the word that you use for extermination there “Ausrottung,”
rooting out, extirpation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: First of all, I would like to ask whether this issue
is known to my defense counsel, and if the translation is correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: It does not matter. He has copies
of all this and he will be able to protect your interests. We are
now just testing the truth of the evidence that you have given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can you tell me, is that “extermination”? Does that mean
murder of Jews? What else can it mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: It depends on the whole context. In that case I
want you to read the whole article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, if there is anything in the
rest of the article which can be helpful to you, your counsel will
have an opportunity to see the article and be able to put it before
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
the Tribunal. I can assure you that the remainder of your articles,
as a general rule, do not assist your case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: When that article appeared, mass killing had
already taken place a long time ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. Well now, we will not
go through this at any length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you will look at your “B” bundle, your bundle of extracts
from the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you should draw his attention to the
date on Page 30-A.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am very much obliged to Your
Lordship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The 25th of December 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you will glance at “B” bundle you will see a number of extracts
going from Page A to Page 21. Now, I would like you to
glance at Page 24 of that “B” bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Page 24?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Yes, Page 24. This is an article
which appeared in the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> on the 27th of
November 1942. I just wondered whether you read this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At the Zionist Congress of Switzerland the representative
of the ‘Jewish Agency’ in Geneva... gave a report on European
Jewry.... The number of victims goes into millions.
If the present conditions continue and the German program
is carried out, it is to be reckoned that, instead of 6 or 7
million Jews in Europe only 2 million will still be left.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then there are the three last lines of the extract:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Jews who were there had mostly been deported to the
notorious unknown destination further to the East. At the
end of this winter the number of victims will be 4 million.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that what you call a hint of disappearance of Jews from the
East?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I cannot recollect that I have ever read that but
I do want to say that if I had read it I would not have believed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well now, let us just turn to the
“A” bundle again and look at the article that you wrote on the
17th of December 1942. It is Page 34-A. This is an article which is
initialed “STR” so I presume it was written by you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The London newspaper, <span class='it'>The Times</span>, of the 16th of September
1942 published a...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have not got it yet.
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Page 34-A.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Just a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Find it for him. It is headed:
“Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The London newspaper, <span class='it'>The Times</span>, of 16 September 1942
published a resolution which had been unanimously passed
by the Board of Deputies of British Jews. This resolution
expresses the grief and horror of the Anglo-Jewish Community
at the unspeakable atrocities committed by Germany
and her allies and vassals against the Jews of Europe which
had only one aim, to exterminate the whole Jewish population
of Europe in cold blood.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, you must have read of that in <span class='it'>The Times</span> because you
say so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Strange how the Jews of the Anglo-Jewish Community
suddenly begin to prick up their ears. When the second
World War began the Führer of the German nation warned
the Jewish warmongers against plunging the world into
a blood bath again. Since then the German Führer has
warned and prophesied again and again that the second
World War, instigated by world Jewry, must necessarily lead
to the destruction of Jewry. In his last speech too, the Führer
again referred to his prophecies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you write that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, this is merely a quotation. It refers to a
forecast from the Führer, of which nobody could possibly tell what
it really meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you had not even read that or the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>,
did you ever hear of the declaration of the United Nations which
was made on the 17th of December 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was submitted to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember hearing of that? You appear to have been
reading <span class='it'>The Times</span>; you appear to have been reading some copies
of the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>. Maybe you heard of this declaration
which was published in London, Washington, and Moscow
at the same time with the assent and support of all Allied nations
and dominions. I will just read it to you and see if you remember it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The attention of the Belgian, Czechoslovak, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Norwegian, Polish, Soviet, United Kingdom,
United States, and Yugoslav Governments and also the French
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
National Committee has been drawn to numerous reports
from Europe that the German authorities, not content with
denying to persons of Jewish race in all the territories over
which their barbarous rule has been extended the most
elementary human rights, are now carrying into effect
Hitler’s often repeated intention to exterminate the Jewish
people in Europe.</p>

<p>“From all the occupied countries Jews are being transported
in conditions of appalling horror and brutality to Eastern
Europe. In Poland, which has been made the principal Nazi
slaughterhouse, the ghettos established by the German invaders
are being systematically emptied of all Jews except
a few highly skilled workers required for war industries.
None of those taken away are ever heard of again. The able-bodied
are slowly worked to death in labor camps. The infirm
are left to die of exposure and starvation, or are deliberately
massacred in mass executions.</p>

<p>“The number of victims of these bloody cruelties is reckoned
in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men,
women, and children.</p>

<p>“The above-mentioned Governments and the French National
Committee condemn, in the strongest possible terms, this
bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination. They declare
that such events can only strengthen the resolve of all freedom-loving
peoples to overthrow the barbarous Hitlerite
tyranny. They reaffirm their solemn resolution to ensure
that those responsible for the crimes shall not escape retribution,
and to press on with the necessary practical measures
to this end.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you never hear of this declaration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know, but if I should have heard of it,
then I would have to say the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the seizure of power the foreign press published so many
atrocity stories, which turned out to be rumors, that I would have
had no reason to believe anything like this; nor is there any mention
here that millions of Jews were killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, you see, it isn’t altogether
uncorroborated. You say you had no reason to believe it; but your
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>, which you were subscribing to, was
saying exactly the same thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would you look at Page 26-B of the “B” bundle? That is the
declaration of the United Nations of the 17th of December. Just
see what the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> says on the 18th. And
there I quote the second paragraph:
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At that time the Polish Government in London gave the
number of Jews executed as 700,000. The Berlin radio hereupon
declared that these reports were untrue, but admitted
that in Poland ‘Jews’ had had to be executed because they
carried out acts of sabotage.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then the last paragraph quoted:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“ ‘Up to the end of September 1942,’ writes the <span class='it'>Daily Telegraph</span>,
‘2 million Jews have lost their lives in Germany and
in the countries occupied by the Axis, and it is to be feared
that the number of victims will be doubled by the end of
this year.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you happen to read that article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I cannot remember having read it, but I would
not have believed it if I had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You see, there is another article
in that same paper on the 23rd of December, in the same terms;
another on the 30th of December; and another on the 8th of January.
Look at what it says on the 8th of January:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Polish Government in London has issued a new declaration
which states that all the information received agrees
that a third of the 3 million odd Jews have lost their lives.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you read that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know, but I have to repeat, I would not
have believed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL GRIFFITH-JONES: Well now, just let’s see just what
you were writing on the 28th of January. Look at 35-A of your
own bundle; 35-A. Now just see what your Chief Editor, the
witness you are going to call, I understand, Hiemer—see what he
has got to say first of all:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“But the ghetto too, which has today been re-established in
nearly all European countries, is only an interim solution,
for mankind once awakened will not merely solve the ghetto
question but the Jewish question in its totality. A time will
come when the present demands, of the Jews will be fulfilled.
The ghetto will have disappeared—and with it Jewry.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What is he referring to, if he isn’t referring to the mass killing,
murder, of the Jewish race?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That was a statement of his opinion, his conviction.
That conviction must be understood in the same way as something
which a Jewish author wrote in his book in America. Erich
Kauffmann wrote that German men capable of fathering children
should be sterilized, and in that manner the German people should
be exterminated. It was at the same time that Hiemer wrote his
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
article, and I want to say that the very severe tone in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
at that time was due to that book from America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interrogating officers know—and so does my counsel—that
I have repeatedly pointed out that I wanted that book to be produced.
It was in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If in America an author called Erich Kauffmann can publicly
demand that all men in Germany capable of fathering children
should be sterilized, for the purpose of exterminating the German
people, then I say, eye for eye and tooth for tooth. This is a
theoretical literary matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. I am sure we have
heard your explanation. Let’s see what you have to say about your
own article on the same date. I quote from the middle of the next
paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“But now, in the fourth year of this war, world Jewry is
beginning in its retrospective considerations to understand
that the destiny of Jewry is finding its fulfillment at the
hands of German National Socialism.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What did you mean by that? Perhaps I should have quoted a
little earlier, going back to the beginning:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When, with the outbreak of the second World War, world
Jewry again began to manifest themselves as warmongers,
Adolf Hitler announced to the world from the platform of
the German Reichstag that the World War conjured up by
world Jewry would result in the self-destruction of Jewry.
This prophecy was the first big warning. It was met with
derision from the Jews, as were all the subsequent warnings.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then you go on to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now, in the fourth year of this war, world Jewry is
beginning in its retrospective considerations to understand
that the destiny of Jewry is finding its fulfillment at the
hands of German National Socialism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What did you mean by that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Pardon me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: What do you mean by saying
“World Jewry is finding its fulfillment at the hands of National
Socialism”? How did you mean that National Socialism was finding
the fulfillment of Jewry’s destiny?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: National Socialism could not fulfill the fate, that
is to say, find the solution, since the Führer intervened with the
hand of destiny. That was not a solution.
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>During an interrogation I pointed out that I who personally
wanted a total solution, was, right from the beginning, against
trying to solve the Jewish problem by means of pogroms. If I said
that the destiny of Jewry was to be fulfilled by National Socialism,
then I wanted to say that through National Socialism the world
would gain the knowledge and the realization that the Jewish
problem must be solved internationally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Let’s just go on.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“That which the Führer of the German people announced to
the world as a prophecy at the beginning of this second
World War is now being fulfilled with unrelenting inevitability.
World Jewry, which wanted to reap big dividends
from the blood of the warring nations, is rushing with gigantic
steps toward its extirpation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And again you use the word “Ausrottung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does that mean just as it sounds, as though the fulfillment that
you were aiming at was warning the world about Jewry? What do
you mean by it? “Rushing with gigantic steps toward its extirpation”—Ausrottung.
What did you mean by it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: This is a warning. The Führer made a prophecy;
nobody could interpret that prophecy properly. The prophecy was
not quoted only in this article, but in 10 others. Again and again
we referred to these prophecies, the first of which had been made
in 1929. Today we know what the Führer wanted to say; at that
time we did not. And I confess quite openly that with this quotation
we wanted to warn world Jewry: “Against their threat, this
threat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So as to defend myself I might mention in this connection that
the author, Dr. Emil Ludwig Kohn, who had left Germany and
emigrated to France, had written in the paper <span class='it'>Le Fanal</span>, in 1934,
“Hitler does not want war, but he is being forced into it. Britain
has the last word.” Thus...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: We are not discussing war now.
We are discussing the extermination, the mass murder of Jews, by
the National Socialists. That is what we are discussing. Let me
read on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When Adolf Hitler stepped before the German people
20 years ago to submit to them the National Socialist demands
which pointed the way into the future, he also made
the promise which was to have the gravest repercussions;
that of freeing the world from its Jewish tormentors. How
wonderful it is to know that this great man and leader is
following up this promise with practical action. It will be
the greatest deed in the history of mankind.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you say that you are not putting forward propaganda for the
policy of mass extermination which the Nazi Government had set
out to do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: We too had freedom of the press like democratic
countries. Every author knew of the forecast, which perhaps later
on turned out to be a fact, and could write about it. That is what
I did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: But for my defense, Mr. Prosecutor, I want to be
allowed to say that wars too can be mass murder, with their bombs,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>. And if it is proved that someone says that we are forcing
Hitler into war, then I can certainly say that a man who knows
that Hitler is being forced into war is a mass murderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: With the permission of the Tribunal
I am going to interrupt you again because we are not discussing
whether or not Hitler was forced into war. We will leave that now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just let us go on and see if you are really speaking the truth in
saying that while you are writing these articles you are not perfectly
well aware of what was happening in the Eastern territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We got as far as January 1943. I would like you to just look
at one or two more of the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> and see if you
remember reading any of these. Will you look at Page 30-B the 26th
of February, in your “B” bundle?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Exchange reports from the Polish Government circles in
London that Warsaw, Lvov, Lodz and other cities have been
‘liquidated,’ and that nobody from the ghettos remained alive.
The last investigations have ascertained that only about
650,000 Jews remain out of 2,800,000.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Listen to me. Did you read that? Do you remember it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know. For months, perhaps half a year,
we did not get an issue, but if I had read it, I would not have
believed that either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Did you believe Hitler? If you will
turn over the page to 31-B, did you believe Hitler? According to
the last two lines quoted in the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> of the
5th of March 1943: “Hitler, in his proclamation of 24 February,
again proclaimed the extermination of the Jews in Europe as his
goal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you believe your own beloved Führer when he was saying
the same things as the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>, the United
Nations, and <span class='it'>The Times</span> newspaper in London?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No, I declare that whoever got to know the
Führer’s deepest emotions and his soul, as I have personally, and
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
then later had to learn from his testament that he, in full possession
of his faculties, consciously gave the order for mass extermination,
is confronted with a riddle. I state here...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: We really don’t want another long
speech about the Führer. Just turn over the page and look at what
is being said on the 26th of March:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The report of the Polish Government on the measures
against the Jewish population is published in full in the
English press. A passage reads, ‘In the town of Vilna 50,000
Jews were murdered, in Rovno 14,000; in Lvov half of the
total Jewish population.’</p>

<p>“Many details are also given about the use of poison gas, as
at Chelm, of electricity in Belzec, of the deportations from
Warsaw, the surrounding of blocks of houses, and of the
attacks with machine guns.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you read that one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know. However, that shootings must
have occurred, of course, where Jews committed sabotage, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>,
is self-evident. During a war that is considered as a matter of
course. However, the figures which are quoted here were just
simply not believable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Yes. I understand you to say that
now, but what I do not understand is what you meant when you
said this morning that the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> made no mention
of murders and gave no figures. You didn’t say that the figures
were unbelievable; you told this Tribunal, on your oath, that the
newspaper contained nothing except the hints of disappearance,
with no mention of figures. What did you mean by that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have said the truth under oath, but it is possible
that one might not remember everything. During an interrogation
some time back I stated, based on memory, that an issue must exist
which mentions the disappearance of Jews, and so on. It is in the
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>, and I thought I said that it was in 1943
and it is true. If one article after the other is put before me—well,
even if I had seen it, how can I remember it? But that I, under
oath, should have deliberately told you an untruth, that is, at any
rate, not so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: We will deal with the article you
mention in 1943 in one moment; but just before we do that, just
see if you believe your own staff. Turn, will you, to 38-A, M-139.
Now, on the 6th of May it so happens just after those last three
extracts from the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> we have looked at,
within 2 or 3 months, 1 or 2 months afterwards your newspaper is
publishing this article. It is headed “Children of the Devil.”
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> paid a visit to the ghettos in the East. <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span> sent its photographic reporter to various ghettos in
the East; a member of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer’s</span> staff is well acquainted
with the Jews. Nothing can surprise him easily. But what
our contributor saw in these ghettos was a unique experience
for him. He wrote, ‘What my eyes and my Leica camera saw
here convinced me that the Jews are not human beings but
children of the devil and the spawn of crime.... It is hard to
see how it was possible that this scum of humanity was for
centuries looked upon as God’s chosen people by the non-Jews.
... This satanic race really has no right to exist.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, you have heard of what was happening in the ghettos in
the East during 1942 and 1943? Are you really telling this Tribunal
that your photographer went with his camera to those ghettos and
found out nothing about the mass murder of Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, otherwise he would have reported to us
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Warsaw ghetto, you remember,
exterminated, wiped out in April 1943. Your photographer must
have been around just about that time, if you were writing this on
the 6th of May, if he had just returned. Did you think he could have
been there looking at ghettos for <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, for Julius Streicher,
the Jew-baiter, and have discovered nothing of what was happening
in the ghetto in Warsaw and elsewhere?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I can only remember that immediately after the
end of the Polish campaign a Viennese reporter went over there,
made films and made reports, in 1942. I would like to ask—is there
a name, a signature there, to show by whom it was written? One
thing I know is that the ghetto was destroyed; I read it in a summary,
an illustrated report which I think originated in the Ministry
of Propaganda. But as to the destruction of the ghetto during an
uprising—well, I consider that legal; from my point of view it was
right. But mass murders in the ghetto in Warsaw are something
I never heard of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Now, just let’s look at the article
to which you referred a moment ago. Will you look at 44-A of the
document book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this is the same as was included at Page 53 in the
original document book; it was Document Number 1965-PS, Exhibit
Number GB-176, but there is slightly more of the extract quoted at
Page 44-A.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now, I just want you to examine for
the last time whether or not you are speaking the truth in telling
the Tribunal that you did not know what was happening. You quote
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
in that article from the Swiss newspaper, the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>,
of the 27th August 1943—you will see that date, My Lord, in
the middle of the first paragraph—I start now from that line in the
middle:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Swiss Jewish newspaper goes on to say, ‘The Jews of
Europe, with the exception of those in England and of insignificant
Jewish communities in the few neutral countries,
have disappeared, so to speak. The Jewish reservoir of the
East that was able to counterbalance the force of assimilation
in the West no longer exists.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is the end of your quotation from the newspaper, and you
go on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This is not a Jewish lie; it is really true that the Jews have,
‘so to speak,’ disappeared from Europe and that the ‘Jewish
reservoir of the East’ from which the Jewish pestilence spread
for centuries among the European nations has ceased to exist.
If the Swiss newspaper wishes to affirm that the Jews did not
expect this kind of development when they plunged the
nations into the second World War, this is to be believed; but
already at the beginning of the war the Führer of the German
Nation prophesied the events that have taken place. He
said that the second World War would swallow those who
had conjured it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, are you really saying that when that article was written
you did not know how to interpret the word “disappearance,” the
disappearance of the Jews from the East? Are you really telling the
Tribunal that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, the word “disappear” after all does not mean
extermination <span class='it'>en masse</span>. This deals with a quotation from the
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> and is a repeated quotation of what the
Führer had prophesied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Well, now, would you look at the
article from which you quote there, which you will find at Page
36-B; and I would like you to follow it, and we will read the two
together. Now, the particular paragraph which I want to read in
the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> is that quotation which I have just
read to you and you will find the same quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it starts at the end of the eighth but last line, “The
Jews were” or rather “The Jews of Europe...” Have you got them
in front of you, Defendant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I shall listen to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: It would be better, I think, if you
followed it. I want to help you as much as possible. Page 44-A
and 36-B. I will read slowly first of all from your <span class='it'>Stürmer</span> again:
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Jews of Europe, with the exception of those in England
and of insignificant Jewish communities in the few neutral
countries, have, so to speak, disappeared...”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and you will see that you then go on in the quotation and say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...the Jewish reservoir of the East which was able to counterbalance
the force of assimilation in the West no longer exists.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, would you look at the original article:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Jews of Europe”—this is 36-B—“the Jews of Europe,
with the exception of those in England and of insignificant
Jewish communities in the few neutral countries, have, so to
speak, disappeared.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now—there you go on, “The Jewish reservoir of the East”—the
original goes on—“three million dead, the same number outlawed;
many thousands, all over the world, mentally and physically
broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are you telling this Tribunal now that on the 27th of August, or
when you read that article of the 27th of August, you didn’t know
that Jews were being murdered in the East and that you had not
read of those things in the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Whether I had read it or not, I would not have
believed it, that 3 million Jews had been killed. That is something
I would not have believed, and that is why I left it out, at any rate.
Anyhow, the German censorship would not have allowed the
spreading of something which is not credible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You didn’t read the last part of the line, did
you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: [<span class='it'>Repeating.</span>] “...were mentally and
physically broken. That is the result of the new order.” I am very
much obliged to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] “That is the result,” you say, “of the
‘new order’ in Europe...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You say you didn’t believe it. Is that what you say now, that
you must have read it—must you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: But you just didn’t believe it; is
that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No, I did not believe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Even if you didn’t believe it, when
you were reading this newspaper more or less regularly, when your
cameraman had been to the ghettos in the East, did you think it
right to go on, week after week, in your newspaper crying for the
extermination, murder, of the Jews?
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is not correct. It is not true that murder was
demanded week after week. And I repeat again, the sharpening of
our tone was the answer to the voice from America that called for
our mass murder in Germany—eye for eye, tooth for tooth. If a
Jew, Erich Kauffmann, demands mass murders in Germany, then
perhaps I, as an author, can say that the Jews too should be exterminated.
That is a literary matter. But the mass murders had
taken place a long time before without our having known about
them; and I state here that if I had known what had in fact
happened in the East, then I would not have used these quotations
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: But, Defendant, you must have
known then, must you not, after reading that article, after sending
your cameraman, after the United Nations published their declaration,
after Hitler’s prophecies had been made again and again
in his proclamations, after you said his prophecy had been fulfilled?
You really say you didn’t know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: The cameraman is at your disposal. He is in
Vienna, and I ask to have him brought here. And I state that this
cameraman reported nothing, and could not have reported anything,
about mass murders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we might adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, with the permission of the Tribunal,
and in the interest of clarification of the facts, I should like to point
out the following: The Prosecutor, Sir Griffith-Jones, has mentioned
a document, Page 38-A from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of 6 May 1943. That
seems to be an error, because we are dealing here with <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
of 6 March 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That date is of the greatest importance because if the photographer
of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> published a report of 6 March in <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span>, then he must have been at the ghetto in Warsaw before
6 March 1943. Presumably...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why do you say 6 March? The document I
have before me has 6 May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: There has been a mistake, I am
afraid, in the German that Dr. Marx has. I have the original before
me, which is 6 May 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me. At the present moment I cannot recall
when the destruction of the ghetto of Warsaw took place. That was
Document 1061-PS.
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I cannot remember for the moment
the number of the document, but the date was, I think from
memory, from the 1st to the 23rd of April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then, of course, my remark is without foundation.
Please excuse me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Now we had just dealt with the
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> issue for 27 August, the copy that you
quoted from. I just refer you to one more copy of that newspaper.
Would you look at Page 37-B, which is an issue of 10 September
1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Statistics presented by the Convening Committee showed
that 5 millions out of the 8.5 million Jews of Europe had died
or been deported ... About 3 million Jews had lost their
lives through forced labor and deportation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you read that one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I do not know, and again I would not have believed
it. To this day I do not believe that 5 million were killed.
I consider it technically impossible that that could have happened.
I do not believe it. I have not received proof of that up until now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: It is quite clear that there were
plenty of figures for you, quoted in this <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>
over the period that we are discussing. Plenty of figures, it now
turns out, doesn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Pardon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: We will go on. Now, I just want
to put one or two further articles of your own to you. You remember
what I am suggesting, that you are inciting the German people
to murder. We know now that at least you had read one article in
the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> where murder is mentioned. I just
want to see what you go on to publish in your own paper after
that date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would you look at Page 47-A. This is an article by yourself on
6 January 1944. This is after you had been living on your estate
for some time.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After the National Socialist uprising in Germany, a development
began in Europe, too, from which one can expect that
it will free this continent for all time of the Jewish disintegrator
and exploiter of nations; and, over and above this,
that the German example will, after a victorious termination
of the second World War, bring about the destruction of the
Jewish world tormentor on the other continents as well.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What example was the German nation setting to the other
nations of the world? What example do you mean there?
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: This article corroborates what I have been saying
all along. I spoke of an international solution of the Jewish question.
I was convinced that if Germany had won this war or had been
victorious over Bolshevism, then the world would have agreed that
an understanding should be reached with the other nations for an
international solution of the Jewish question. If I wrote here about
destruction, it is not to be understood as destruction by mass killing;
as I have said, that is an expression; I have to point out that I do
not believe that Erich Kauffmann really wanted to kill the German
people by sterilization, but he wrote it, and we sometimes wrote
in the same manner, echoing the sounds that we heard in the other
camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You have not yet told us what is
this international solution that you are advocating by talking about
extermination; if it is not murder, what is it? What is the solution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I have already said that I founded the Anti-Semitic
Union, and through this Anti-Semitic Union we wanted to create
movements among the nations which should, above and beyond
governments, act in such a way that an international possibility
would be created, such as has been represented today here in this
Trial—thus, I conceived it, to form an international congress center
which would solve the Jewish question by the creation of a Jewish
state and thereby destroy the power of the Jews within the nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: That is your answer—that you
were advocating a Jewish state? Is that all that this comes to? Is
it simply that you were advocating a Jewish national home? Is that
what you have been talking about in all these extracts that we have
read? Is that the solution which you are advocating?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Well, I do not know what you want with that
question. Of course, that is the solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well. Let us just go on now.
Turn to Page 48-A now, will you? This is 24 January 1944,
“Whoever does what a Jew does is a scoundrel, a criminal, and he
who repeats and wishes to copy him deserves the same fate—annihilation,
death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are you still advocating a national Jewish home?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, that has nothing to do with the big political
plan. If you take every statement by a writer, every statement
from a daily newspaper, as an example, and want to prove a political
aim by it, then you miss the point. You have to distinguish
between a newspaper article and a great political aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well, let us just turn now to
the next page, 2 March 1944, “Eternal night must come over the
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
born criminal race of Jews so that eternal day may bless awakening
non-Jewish mankind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Were they going to have eternal night in their national Jewish
state? Is that what you wanted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is an anti-Semitic play of words. Again it
has nothing to do with the great political aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: It may be an anti-Semitic play of
words, but the only meaning it can have is murder. Is that not true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Will you turn to the next page,
25 May 1944; and I remind you that these are all after you must
have read of the murder in <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>. I quote the
second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“How can we overcome this danger and restore humanity to
health? Just as the individual human being is able to defend
himself against contagious diseases only if he proclaims war
against the cause of the disease, the germ, so the world can
be restored to health only when the most terrible germ of all
times, the Jew, has been removed. It is of no avail to battle
against the outward symptoms of the world disease without
rendering the morbific agents innocuous. The disease will
break out again sooner or later. The cause and the carrier of
the disease, the germ, will see to that. But if the nations are
to be restored to health and are to remain healthy in the
future, then the germ of the Jewish world plague must be
destroyed, root and branch.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that what you mean? Are you saying there when you say
“must be destroyed root and branch”—did you mean to say “ought
to be given a Jewish national state”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, it is a far cry from such a statement in an
article to the act, or to the will, to commit mass murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Turn over to the 10th of August.
“When it loses this struggle, Judaism will be ruined, then the Jew
will be extinguished. Then will Judaism be annihilated down to
the last man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are we to read from these words: Provide the Jews with a
Jewish national state?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: That is a vision of the future. I would like to call
it an expression of a prophetic vision. But it is not incitement to
kill 5 million Jews. That is an opinion, a matter, of belief, of conviction.
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: It is the prophetic vision of what
you wanted, is it not—of what you have been advocating now for
the last 4 years—the beginning of the war? Isn’t that what it is?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Mr. Prosecutor, I cannot tell you today what I
may have been thinking years ago at a certain moment when
writing an article. But still I admit that when I saw lying before
me on the table declarations from the Jewish front, many declarations
saying, “the German nation has to be destroyed; bomb the
cities, do not spare women, children, or old men”—if one has declarations
like these in front of one, it is possible that things will come
from one’s pen such as I have often written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: You know, do you not, now, even
if you do not believe the full figures, that millions of Jews have
been murdered since the beginning of the war? Do you know that?
You have heard the evidence, have you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I believe it...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I only wanted to know whether
you had heard that evidence. You can answer “yes” or “no,” and
I presume it will be “yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Yes, I have to say, evidence for me is only the
testament of the Führer. There he states that the mass executions
took place upon his orders. That I believe. Now I believe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Do you think that it would have
been possible to carry out the extermination of 6 million Jews in
1921? Do you think the German people would have stood for it?
Do you think it would have been possible under any regime in 1921
to have carried out the murder of 6 million men, women, and
children of the Jewish race?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Whether that would have been possible with the
knowledge of the people—no, it would not have been possible. The
prosecutor himself has said here that since 1937 the Party had full
control over the people. Now even if the people had known this,
according to the opinion of the Prosecution, they could not have
done anything against that dictatorship because of that control.
But the people did not know it. That is my belief, my conviction,
and my knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Was it possible to exterminate
people in that way only after some 20 years of incitement and
propaganda by you and other Nazis? Is that what made that
possible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: I deny that the population was incited. It was
enlightened, and sometimes a harsh word may have been directed
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
against the other side as an answer. It was enlightenment, not
incitement. And if we want to keep our place before history I have
to state again and again that the German people did not want any
killings, whether individually or <span class='it'>en masse</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am not going to let you go into
another history about the German people. I am going to remind
you of what you have said...</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: Adolf Hitler...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am going to remind you of what
you said yesterday. I read from the transcript: You speak of a
Jewish question at the time—that is 1923—“I would like to say that
the public distinguished Jews only by their religion; to speak about
a Jewish problem then would have been nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was that because there was no Jewish problem then, and that
the Jewish problem had only been created by you and the Nazi
regime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STREICHER: It was my aim, and I reached that goal in part:
If the laws which in the future should make impossible sexual
intercourse between different races, that is to say if that should
become law—then it would make the public realize that to be a Jew
is not a point of religion but of people and race. I helped to create
that basis. But mass killings were not the result of the enlightenment,
or as the Prosecution say, incitement. Mass killings were
the last acts of will of a great man of history who was probably
desperate because he saw that he would not win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I have no further questions. Perhaps
I might be allowed to just sort out the exhibits and then
mention to the Tribunal their numbers. If the Tribunal would
agree, those that I have put in evidence, which are the other parts
of the bundle other than I have actually quoted from—perhaps I
could put them all in as one number and hand the exhibits in to
the clerk, if that would be the convenient course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think so, yes. If they are in one bundle
and you are going to give one number to a number of documents,
it had better be in one bundle, had it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, do you want to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I do not consider it necessary any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the defendant can return to the dock.
Dr. Marx, will you continue the defendant’s case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I call now, with the permission of the Court, the
witness Fritz Herrwerth.
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Herrwerth took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZ HERRWERTH (Witness): Fritz Herrwerth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: “I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How long have you known the Defendant Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Since the Party Rally in 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: When did you enter his service and in what
capacity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I was employed on 15 October 1934, in Nuremberg,
not in the personal service of Herr Streicher himself, but in
the municipal motor pool. However, I worked for the then Gauleiter
Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: When did you leave that service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: In August 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: For what reason?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: It was a personal dispute, and mainly due to
my fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you have any other tasks to carry out for Herr
Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And which?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Well, whatever came up. I also did agricultural
work at the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Thus you were very often with Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And therefore you knew about the most important
incidents during that period?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes. I do not know, however, what you call
important incidents. There were things that I do not know about,
that is, at least I assume that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I will ask you later in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes, if you please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The Defendant Streicher is accused of having caused
acts of violence against the Jews and of having participated in
these acts. Do you know of any such case?
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Not a single one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Will you please wait until the end of my question,
and then I shall say “end of question.” On 9 November 1938, did
you drive Streicher back to Nuremberg from Munich, and when?
End of question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: It was on 9 November, yes. I do not know the
time exactly. At that time Streicher left Munich a bit earlier, and
it may have been about—I do not know for sure—9 o’clock perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did Streicher know already during that ride back
that something was to be done that night against the Jewish
population?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: No, he knew nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then, during the night of 9 November, did you
witness a conversation between Streicher and the SA Leader, Von
Obernitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Where did that conversation take place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: In order to answer that question, I have to
explain a little further. When Herr Streicher went to bed, I was
usually with him or the house superintendent. On that evening
Herr Streicher went to bed earlier than usual. I do not know the
reason. And that concluded my work for the day. I went from Herr
Streicher to the Casino of the Gauleitung. That was in the cellar
of the Gauleitung building on Schlageterstrasse. I played cards
there. And then the former SA Obergruppenführer, Von Obernitz,
came and called me, as was customary, by the name of Fritz and
told me he had to speak to Herr Streicher very urgently; and I
answered him that Herr Streicher had already gone to bed. Then
he said, “Then I must rouse him,” and he told me he would assume
the responsibility; it was an important affair. Herr Von Obernitz
went to Herr Streicher’s apartment in my car. Herr Streicher’s
bedroom is above my apartment. I had the keys and of course I
could get in at any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way to the apartment at night I noticed that many SA
men were in the streets. I asked Herr Von Obernitz the reason
for that. He told me that that night something was going to happen;
the Jewish homes were to be destroyed. He did not say anything
further to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I accompanied Herr Von Obernitz all the way to the bed of
Herr Streicher. Herr Von Obernitz then reported to Streicher about
what was happening that night. I cannot recall the details very
well any more, but I believe that he said that that night the Jewish
homes were to be destroyed. Herr Streicher was, if I may say so,
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
surprised. He had not known anything about it. He said literally
to Herr Von Obernitz, and I remember that very clearly, “That is
wrong. One does not solve the Jewish question that way. Do what
you have been ordered. I shall have no part in it. If anything
should occur so that you need me, then you may come for me.”
I can also mention that thereupon Herr Von Obernitz said that
Hitler had declared that the SA should be allowed to have a fling
as retribution for what had occurred in Paris in connection with
Herr Vorn Rath. Streicher stayed in bed and did not go out during
that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did Herr Von Obernitz mention anything about the
fact that the synagogues were to be set on fire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I believe so, yes. But, as far as I remember,
Herr Streicher refused to do that, too, because the synagogue, as
far as I know, was burned down by the regular fire department,
and upon orders from Herr Von Obernitz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How do you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you watch it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes. I was at the synagogue during the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And how could one assume that the regular fire
department started the fire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: How that could be assumed I do not know, but
I saw it. The regular fire department started the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you there in time to see how the fire was
started or did you arrive when the building was already on fire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: The building was not yet on fire, but the fire
department was there already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I can say nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did Herr Streicher at that time mention anything
about the fact that he was afraid of a new wave of excitement on
the part of the world press if the synagogue was burned? Did he
say that that is why he refused to do it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I believe so, yes, but I could not say definitely;
but, if I remember correctly, they spoke about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did Obernitz say from whom he had received the
order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: He only repeated what Hitler had said—the SA
should be allowed to have a fling.
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it correct that you, Witness, told your wife
during the same night about that conversation between Obernitz
and Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I believe I did not speak about the conversation;
but when I walked down from the second floor to the ground floor
through my apartment, I told my wife that I would probably be a
little late because that night that action was going to be started;
I told her briefly what was happening but nothing about the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then, later you were at the Pleikershof when
Streicher had been forced to retire there or had retired?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you remember an incident where the future
Frau Streicher spoke about the incidents at Magdeburg which had
occurred there the same night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: No, I know nothing of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you not tell the then Frau Merkel that she
should not talk about these incidents because Streicher always got
very excited about them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I can recall that Herr Streicher once said that
he had been right in his opinion, for, not long after that night he
received information—I do not know through whom—that, for
instance, the glass for the window panes had to be bought from
Holland again. Herr Streicher said then that that was the first confirmation
of the correctness of the opinion he had expressed at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, just one moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir David, would it be convenient to you and the counsel for the
Defendant Von Schirach if we discussed the question about the
documents at 0930 tomorrow morning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I will find out. Yes,
counsel for Von Schirach says that he thinks it is all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, 0930 tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What observations did you make during your stay
at Pleikershof about the attitude of Streicher with regard to the
Jewish question? What was that about the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Well, what do you want to know about the
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>? Herr Streicher received it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did he receive it regularly?
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes, I believe I can say that quite certainly. I
always saw large bundles of newspapers of the <span class='it'>Israelitisches
Wochenblatt</span>. They came continuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Streicher said that during the first years of
the war he had great difficulty in getting that paper and the Police
did not release it easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes, that can very well be. For I do not know,
after all, of what year they were. I just saw them and it is difficult
for me to tell now of what date these papers were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, you said there were always large bundles
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes, on and off, but there were other newspapers
too. Swiss newspapers were there, the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>,
and so on. There were always so many newspapers lying
about and among them I saw here and there the <span class='it'>Israelitisches
Wochenblatt</span>. I mean to say that it would not be possible for me
to say how many there were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: All right. Did Streicher speak at times about his
knowledge of happenings in the East or of happenings in concentration
camps in the East?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Well. Herr Streicher did not know anything at
all about it. Thus he could not say anything about it. At least that
is my conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you, then, ever speak to him about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Not that I know of; I did not know anything
about it myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you ever receive knowledge of a letter in which
Streicher was reproached by Reichsführer SS Himmler because he
treated the French prisoners too well? Did you understand me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes, I understood, but I have to think about it.
I know quite well that Herr Streicher once mentioned something
about the treatment of prisoners. I know that the Frenchmen were
treated very well, but whether the cause for that was a letter from
Himmler I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: No, no. The cause for the good treatment, you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: No, the cause for Herr Streicher’s speaking about
it. Herr Streicher spoke about reproaches against the good treatment
of the Frenchmen; but I do not know whether the fact that
he spoke about it was due to a letter from Himmler. But I do not
believe that there was a single Frenchman who could complain in
any way about the treatment.
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You were no longer present when the Frenchmen
left?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know about an incident when the publisher
Fink came into the garden of Streicher’s home and admitted having
lied to the police in an affair concerning shares?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: The question must be put in detail, Mr. Attorney,
for I do not know all about it, only part of it. I know that the
then Director Fink stood in tears before Streicher, that he wailed,
that he accused himself, saying that he was a rascal and a traitor.
But why, I do not know. For Herr Streicher then walked farther
into the garden with him, and I only saw that Herr Fink wept, and
again heard how he accused himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know that Streicher at certain intervals
brought people from the SPD and the KPD (Social Democratic
Party and Communist Party) from the Dachau Concentration Camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How many do you suppose there were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I do not know. It was every year around Christmas
time. I estimate that there were about 100 to 150 men every
year. They came from Dachau. Herr Streicher had dinner prepared
for them in a separate room, in the Hotel Deutscher Hof, and I
believe that used to be the family reunion—that is to say, the
prisoners rejoined the members of their family. Streicher also saw
to it that released prisoners found work, and he intervened personally
for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did he also get work for one or another of these
released persons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What do you know about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I remember that three men, I believe, came into
the Mars motorcycle factory. Herr Streicher at that time told the
plenipotentiary of the German Labor Front to find positions for
these people, as far as I remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What was the attitude of Streicher when he found
out that members of the Party had acquired cars and villas of
Jewish property at very low prices?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I can still remember when Herr Streicher returned
from Berlin. I do not know how much Herr Streicher knew
at that time about these purchases; but at any rate, when Herr
Streicher returned from Berlin where Herr Göring had expressed
his views about these low-priced purchases of buildings, Herr
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
Streicher, just arrived at the Nuremberg railroad station, said—and
I heard it myself—that these purchases had to be nullified
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, I know only about one case where a Party member had
to do with the purchase of a house. I do not know whether there
were more of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know whether Streicher was under surveillance
by the Gestapo while on his farm and that there was a prohibition
against visiting him there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: In answering the first question, I cannot say for
sure that Criminal Police agents were there. I cannot affirm categorically
that Herr Streicher was once under observation, but it
could be safely assumed. I know of a woman who even stated that
she had been photographed in the forest when she came from the
railroad station to the farm. And what was the second question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Whether people were prohibited from visiting him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes. I met various members of the Party within
the city and whomever I asked said to me, “Impossible to get out
there, impossible to get out there.” And if I asked who had issued
the prohibition, then no one would talk about it; but as one heard
it here and there, this prohibition was said to have been issued
by the Deputy of the Führer, Herr Hess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know anything about the fact that Streicher,
when he found out that acts of violence against Jews or other
political adversaries were intended, stopped them immediately?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes. At least, on the basis of his statements.
He always said that that was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know of any case where he took measures
against somebody who had been a party to such acts of violence?
If you do not know it, say you do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Very well, at this moment I cannot recall any
case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know anything about that affair concerning
the Mars Works shares? What do you know about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes. I know about that case through statements
made by Streicher at that time. I was not a witness to these events
myself, but Herr Streicher once related to me what had happened.
Shall I describe it briefly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, but very condensed, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Streicher was in a Turkish bath at the time
when the Director Fink and his adjutant, König, came and offered
to sell the shares to Herr Streicher. Herr Streicher said, “What
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
kind of shares are they?” The answer was, “They are shares of
the Mars Works.” He said, “How many?” The answer was “100,000
marks’ worth.” Then Streicher said, “What do the shares cost?”
He was told “5,000 marks.” Herr Streicher asked, “Why are these
shares so cheap?” Finally Herr Fink said, I believe, “Because they
are Jewish shares.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever knows Herr Streicher as I do, knows that Herr Streicher
has never taken anything from a Jew. He protested very emphatically
against the fact that such an offer had been made to him
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That seemed to settle the matter for the time being, and then
suddenly the then Gauleiter Herr Streicher had the thought that
with that money he could possibly construct the third Gau building.
He mentioned that to the gentlemen as they left, and they
decided to buy the shares. Herr Streicher forbade them to use Party
money. Then both did not know what to do. Herr Streicher said
he would advance these 5,000 marks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That settled the case, but I had another experience later. It
was about one and a half years after that trial that Streicher had
had in Munich, when he was dismissed. At that time the wife of
NSKK Obergruppenführer Zühlen came to me and asked whether
I already knew that the criminal police was again in Nuremberg
concerning the Streicher case. I said “no” to Frau Zühlen and
added, “If they want to find out something why do they not come
out to the farm to Herr Streicher himself? He will give them all
the necessary information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After about 2 to 3 weeks, I met the Director of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>,
Fischer, successor to Herr Fink. He told me—but I would like to
mention first that the shares, together with the 5,000 marks, were
confiscated from Herr Streicher. The then Director Fischer told
me that on that same day he had received a phone call from the
trustee association, and that the trustee association had reported
to Director Fischer that they had transferred to the account of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> the 5,000 marks which Streicher at that time had advanced
for the purchase of the shares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, do you not think he is going into
rather too much detail about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes, I will make it shorter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man from the trustee association said that the 5,000 marks
were released because the innocence of Streicher had been proved
in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You witnessed the Supreme Party Court session at
that time?
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What did Herr Fink say at that time? Did he not
accuse himself again of having made false statements?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: I was not present when Herr Fink was questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Very well. Then I would like to ask you, were you
present when the incident in Munich occurred at the Künstlerhaus
Inn—with the man who accosted Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Can you give us a description of how that incident
occurred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Well, Herr Streicher left the inn after dinner.
I cannot remember the exact words any more, but I am going to
try to describe it as well as possible. Herr Streicher left the inn,
and as he went out that man approached Herr Streicher in a—may
I say—improper manner. Streicher continued on his way and was
silent at first. He asked the people around him, myself also, whether
we knew that man. Nobody knew him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Herr Streicher sent his son, Lothar, back into the room
again to speak to the man and to ask him what the reason was for
such behavior. Lothar Streicher came out and said that the man
had behaved in just the same manner again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Will you please be more brief? You should only
tell us how that incident occurred and what caused you and also
Herr Streicher to use violence against the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: You mean his behavior?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. What happened then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HERRWERTH: Herr Streicher asked the landlord for a room,
and in that room Streicher spoke to the man personally. There
again the man made offensive remarks, and then it came to blows,
first with Lothar Streicher. Now, as it happened, he was a strong
man, and of course all of us helped to get him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: All right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am through with the questioning of this witness, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the Defense Counsel want to ask
any questions? Do any of the Prosecution Counsel wish to cross-examine?
Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then I should like to call the witness Wurzbacher,
if he is available. Is he not? I do not know which one of the
witnesses is still in the witness room. Is there anyone? Wurzbacher?
Hiemer?
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL (Colonel Charles W. Mays): Frau Streicher is available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is not the witness Wurzbacher here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: I will see, Sir. He was not here a while ago. He
was not called for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What other witnesses have you got, Dr. Marx?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The wife of the defendant could be called as a
witness now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, let her be called then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: The witness Strobel is available now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx wants to call Frau Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me, Mr. President. If it is rather difficult
to call Frau Streicher, then the witness...</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Frau Streicher took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you give me your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU ADELE STREICHER (Witness): Adele Streicher, born
Tappe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: “I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Your maiden name is Tappe and you were born
in Magdeburg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you a member of the NSDAP or of the
Frauenschaft?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: When did you become Herr Streicher’s secretary
and for how long were you in that job?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: On 7 June 1940, I became Julius Streicher’s
secretary and I remained in that job until the end of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And during that period, you were continuously on
his farm?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes, I was always with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you also in charge of all the correspondence
for Herr Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What did that correspondence mainly consist of?
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Mainly letters to his sons and to relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What were Streicher’s activities during that period
of 5 years?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Julius Streicher did mainly physical work;
that is, agriculture and gardening, and from time to time he wrote
articles for <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: During these 5 years did he leave the farm at all
or was he ever absent from the farm for any length of time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: During the first few years of his stay
there Julius Streicher did not leave the farm at all; later, once in
a while, he would pay a visit in the neighborhood. His longest
absence did not comprise an entire day and never a single night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you know that it was prohibited for prominent
Party members to visit Herr Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes, there was such a prohibition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How did you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: From conversations. Then, too, I myself
remember, when Dr. Goebbels visited the farm, that Julius Streicher
said to him, “Doctor, you dare to come here? Do you not know
that it is prohibited by the Party chiefs to visit me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: When did the visits of Dr. Ley and Dr. Goebbels
occur?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Dr. Ley came to the farm on 7 May 1944.
The visit of Dr. Goebbels occurred on 4 June 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Would you please describe the character of these
visits and what was the subject of the conversations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Both visits were of a rather unofficial
character. Dr. Ley wanted mainly to know how Julius Streicher
was doing, personally. No political questions were raised. Ley
said only, “Streicher, the Führer is waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And what did Streicher say to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Julius Streicher answered that he had
become accustomed to his solitude, that he was happy as a farmer,
and that Ley should tell the Führer that he, Streicher, wanted
nothing more. At the visit of Dr. Goebbels the subject of the conversation
dealt mainly with Julius Streicher’s dismissal from his
office as Gauleiter, and Dr. Goebbels was of the opinion that Julius
Streicher should return into the circle of old Party members; but
he gave him the same answer, “Tell the Führer I wish for nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you always present during these conversations?
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was not the Jewish question a subject of these conversations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: No, they never spoke about the Jewish
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did they not speak about the happenings in the
Eastern territories, or in the concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: No, that never came up any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did not Streicher speak to you about the articles he
intended to write for <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, and did he not also speak about
what he considered to be the solution of the Jewish problem?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: From all conversations with Julius
Streicher I could see with certainty that he never thought of the
solution of the Jewish question in terms of violence, but hoped
for the emigration of Jews from Europe and their settlement in
territories outside Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was Herr Streicher in correspondence with leading
personalities of the Party or of the State?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: No, neither personally nor by correspondence
was there any such connection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I will now mention several names, of whom I want
you to tell me whether they had any connection with him: Himmler,
Heydrich, Bormann, or other leading men of the Police or the SS
or the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: No, I know nothing of any of these men.
With the exception of one letter from Herr Himmler there was
never any mail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What was the reason for that letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: In that letter Herr Himmler complained
about the fact that the French prisoners of war who were employed
on our Pleikershof farm were treated too well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How was the treatment of the prisoners of war and
the foreign civilian workers on the farm?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: On the Pleikershof eight French prisoners
of war, one Polish girl, and one Slovene girl were employed. They
were all treated very well and very humanely. Each service for
which Julius Streicher asked, each piece of work for which he asked
personally, was especially rewarded with tobacco, pastry, fruit, or
even money. Such cordial relations developed with some of the
Frenchmen during the years that they were there that they assured
us, with tears in their eyes at their departure, that they would
visit Julius Streicher after the war with their families.
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did Streicher not finally receive credible information
about these mass executions in the East?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: I believe he found out about it through
Swiss newspapers in 1944. We were never informed about it officially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But it is asserted that he already had knowledge
before that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You do not know anything about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: I only know about the Swiss newspapers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Very well. You once brought up the subject, in a
conversation, that in Magdeburg, from the 9 to 10 November 1938,
you witnessed the demonstration against the Jews and that you
were revolted by it. Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes, I spoke about it and said that I was
shocked at this action. Julius Streicher got very excited during
that conversation and said, “Such nonsense occurred in Nuremberg
also. That is not anti-Semitism; that is just great stupidity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it correct that Herr Streicher was hardly interested
in the financial affairs of the publishing firm and left these
things to the manager?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Julius Streicher never bothered about
financial affairs at all, neither in the house nor in the firm. Again
and again the gentlemen of the firm were disappointed when they
wanted to report about annual balances or the like and Julius
Streicher would tell them, “Do not worry me with your business
matters. There are other things besides that are more important
than money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How did he take care of the household expenses,
then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: I received 1,000 marks every month from
the firm. That provided for the household, presents, and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know that he is supposed to have acquired
shares through illegal pressure against a Jewish banker?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: That is completely out of the question. I
consider it quite impossible that Julius Streicher acquired shares
that way. I believe that he does not even know what a share looks
like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did he not tell you anything about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: I only heard that he never received shares.
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How did it come about that you and the defendant
were married as late as April 1945?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you understand the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes. Julius Streicher wanted to take part in
the fighting in Nuremberg. I wanted to accompany him, so he
married me before we left. We wanted to die together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then you left the Pleikershof with him, and where
did you go from there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: First we wanted to go to Nuremberg, and
that was refused for fear of difficulties with the authorities. So we
drove in the direction of Munich. In Munich we were told to continue
in the direction of Passau. From Passau they sent us to
Berchtesgaden; from Berchtesgaden they sent us to Kitzbühel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How did it happen that the original intention to die
together was not followed up? What caused him to change his mind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: The cause for that was a conversation with
three young soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And what was that? I will be through right away,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not think you should go into that,
Dr. Marx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Well, then. I will forego the question. Only one more
question: Is it correct that Streicher gave the managers of his
publishing firm a written power of attorney which meant that they
could dispose of the money as they saw fit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRAU STREICHER: Yes, Julius Streicher gave the power of
attorney to whoever happened to be the manager of the firm, and
thereby gave him his full confidence without any restrictions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, I have no more questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel want to
ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can retire, and the Court
will adjourn until 0930 tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 30 April 1946 at 0930 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEENTH DAY</span><br/> Tuesday, 30 April 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Dodd, were you going to deal with these
questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, Mr. President, I am prepared to do so. Shall I
proceed to take up those documents about which we have some
difficulty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you will, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Altogether, there are some 118 documents submitted
on behalf of the Defendant Von Schirach. As a result of our conversations
we have agreed on all but—I believe the number is
twelve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first group, Numbers 30, 31, 45, 68, 73, 101, 109, 124, and 133,
are all excerpts from a book entitled, <span class='it'>Look, the Heart of Europe</span>,
written by a man named Stanley McClatchie. They are excerpts
referring to the Hitler Youth organization, and we do object to
them on the ground that they are all irrelevant and immaterial here.
They describe Hitler Youth meetings at homes and Hitler health
programs and Hitler athletic competitions and Hitler Youth Land
Service and that sort of thing. There are general descriptions by
Mr. McClatchie of some activities of the Hitler Youth organization.
They are all, I say, from that same book—none of them written by
the defendant himself. They were published in 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Document Number 118 (a) is a letter. It is unsigned,
except that it is typewritten. It is by Colin Ross and his wife and
it appears to be a suicide note setting forth the reasons why Ross
and his wife intended to commit suicide. We have been unable to
determine its probative value and do not see any probative value in
it, insofar as the issues concerning this defendant are concerned. He
apparently was acquainted with the Defendant Von Schirach and
that is the claim, I assume, of counsel for Von Schirach, that it sheds
some light of some kind on Von Schirach’s attitude. But it is not
clear to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third document is Number 121. This is a quotation from the
United States Army newspaper, <span class='it'>The Stars and Stripes</span>, issue of the
21st of February 1946. It is about the training of young people in
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
Yugoslavia at the present time. With respect to this we also say
that we believe it to be immaterial here and not relevant and not
bearing on the issues concerning this defendant as charged in the
Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those three—the first group and the two, 118 and 121, are the
only documents concerning which we have any controversy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Eleven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I am sorry. I said twelve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ SAUTER (Counsel for Defendant Von Schirach): Mr.
President, the first group of documents to which the Prosecution
has objected are from a book by an American, McClatchie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This American, as he himself writes in the book, is of Scottish
descent, and in the year 1936—that was the year of the Olympic
Games—visited Germany; he was able to see for himself the conditions
in Germany and the development of the German people
during the first years of the Hitler regime, and here he describes
the impressions he received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Normally, I would not attach any special value to this book, if it
were not for the fact that the preface shows that the book was
written on suggestion of the Defendant Baldur von Schirach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant, as he will explain in the course of his own
examination, began very early to build up a pleasant and friendly
relationship especially with the United States, and this book by
McClatchie is one of the many means which the Defendant Von
Schirach used for that purpose. The author himself admits in the
preface of his book that he obtained a large part of the material for
the book from the Defendant Von Schirach. This fact lends to the
book an importance, with respect to its relevancy for the purposes
of this Trial in the defense of Von Schirach, entirely different from
what it would have been had it been written quite independently
of Von Schirach. That is, we have to evaluate the statements and
descriptions in this book more or less as though they were statements
of the Defendant Von Schirach himself. This is the main
reason why I have submitted the book with the request that I be
permitted to quote in evidence some short passages, particularly
those referring to the Youth Leadership. The rest of the book,
which is also interesting but has no direct connection with the
Youth Leadership of the Defendant Von Schirach, have not mentioned;
I refer only to a few short extracts which shed light exclusively
on the activity and the aims of the Defendant Von
Schirach; and, besides, they are intended to show you, Gentlemen,
what impression even a foreigner gained of this activity, although
naturally he had come to Germany with a certain prejudice which
had to be overcome by his personal impressions.
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>That, Mr. President, is what I wanted to say to the first group,
which the prosecutor listed individually from Numbers 30 to 133.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second group consists of Number 118(a) of the Document
Book Schirach, and that is a letter of farewell which the explorer,
Dr. Colin Ross, left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the prosecutor objects that the letter bears no signature, the
fact, in my opinion, is not particularly important. What we have
submitted is the original copy of that last letter, and this original
copy was found among the papers of Dr. Colin Ross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the Prosecution ask: What has that farewell letter by
Dr. Colin Ross to do with the charges against Schirach? I ask the
Tribunal to recall that the name of Dr. Colin Ross has been mentioned
here repeatedly. He is the explorer—I believe an American
by birth but I am not certain at the moment. He is the man who
for many years was not only a close friend of Schirach’s but one
whom the Defendant Von Schirach used again and again in order
to prevent the outbreak of a war with the United States, and later,
to terminate the war and to bring about peace with the United
States. When the evidence is presented, these points will be clarified
in detail, I believe. I now submit the last letter of Dr. Colin
Ross...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When was it dated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: One moment please. The date is 30 April 1945.
I consider the letter—it is only one page long—important for the
reason that in it a man, at a moment before he committed suicide
with his wife because he was desperate about the future of Germany,
at this moment—in the face of death, he again confirmed the
fact that he, together with the Defendant Von Schirach, continuously
endeavored to maintain peace particularly with the United States.
I believe, Gentlemen, that such a man...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where was he at the time when, as I understand
you to say, he committed suicide?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: The Defendant Von Schirach...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, no, the man who wrote the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: One moment, please. The Defendant Von Schirach
had a small house in Upper Bavaria in Urfeld on the Walchensee,
and in that house Colin Ross lived at the time with his wife, and
it was here in Schirach’s house that he committed suicide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter is only one page, and it would not cause any considerable
delay in the proceedings if it were read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Gentlemen, the third group to which the Prosecution
objects again consists of one number only—a comparatively short
article from <span class='it'>The Stars and Stripes</span>, Number 121. That edition of
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
which I shall submit the original in evidence is of 21 February 1946,
that is, of this year. It explains in detail how the education of youth
in Yugoslavia has now been reorganized by Marshal Tito, and the
Defendant Von Schirach attaches particular value to this document
because it proves that in Yugoslavia a definitely military education
of youth has been decided upon this very year. The Defendant Von
Schirach therefore desires to make a comparison between the kind
of education which he promoted and the Yugoslav education of
youth which has been adopted only this year, and which goes very
much further than the program of the Defendant Von Schirach did
at any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, may I make just one or two short
observations? I realize that ordinarily the Tribunal does not want
to hear from counsel twice, but there are two matters I feel I
should clear up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, this book, <span class='it'>Look, the Heart of Europe</span>, which may
have been written by this man McClatchie, who, counsel says, is an
American of Scotch ancestry—I think it is important that the
Tribunal know that it was published in Germany. I am sure that
counsel did not mean to imply that it was an American publication
because, other than having been written by this man, it was
published over here after he attended the Olympic Games in 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And in the German language, I suppose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, and the German title was <span class='it'>Sieh: Das Herz
Europas</span>. Then with respect to the Colin Ross note. I think it is
important to observe that no one knows whether Ross committed
suicide or not—at least insofar as the Allied countries are concerned.
His body has never been found and only this note which counsel
says was found among his effects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, may I make another remark concerning
the first group? This book by McClatchie was published by
a German publisher. The efforts of the Defendant Von Schirach
made the publication possible. That again speaks for the fact that
Von Schirach in furthering the publication had a certain purpose in
view. That purpose was to bring about enlightenment between
America and Germany and to smooth over the difficulties which he
was afraid could one day lead to war. The book by McClatchie
appeared not only in German, but also in the English language, and
it was sold in large numbers in England and in the United States.
Of course, it also appeared in German and the German language
edition was sold in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, I believe, is all I wish to say at this point.
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you tell the Tribunal what these other
documents are that Mr. Dodd has not objected to? Because we
understand that there are 160 documents which he has not objected
to. What are they all about, and how long are they?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: They are short. I have submitted only one Document
Book. That is, I have limited myself to the absolute necessities,
Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Of how many pages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Altogether, 134 pages. Of course, some cover only
one-half or one-third of a page, since the majority are relatively
short quotations. It was necessary for me to submit these excerpts,
because I can produce evidence of the activities of the Defendant
Von Schirach as Reich Youth Leader only by showing the Tribunal
just what the Defendant Von Schirach told the youth of the German
nation, what his teachings were, what his directives to his subordinate
leaders were. And in order to do so, I must submit, as I
believe the Prosecution realizes, a short report covering the entire
period during which Von Schirach was Reich Youth Leader, so as
to show that the opinions and theories of the Defendant Von
Schirach during the last year of his activity as Reich Youth Leader
were exactly the same as those during his first year. He is one of
the few men within the Party who did not, in the course of the
years, allow themselves to become violent, he did not go to extremes
as did most of the others; and that is what I want to show by these
comparatively short excerpts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that is all at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then you have the supplementary applications
for witnesses, have you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You’d better deal with those, had you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, one of them, I understand, is a person
who made an affidavit which has been used by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: I believe that is the witness Uiberreither.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, I think it is the other one, is it not? Who
are the two?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: One is, I believe...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Marsalek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: No, not Marsalek, but Uiberreither. Marsalek, Mr.
President,...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have your application before me for Marsalek.
You do not want Marsalek?
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: No, that must be an error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dated the 15th of April 1946. Anyhow, you
do not want him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, then you only want one, do you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And that is Uiberreither?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has the Prosecution any objection to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: No, we have not, Your Honor. That
affidavit I believe, was introduced by us in connection with the
Kaltenbrunner case, an affidavit by Uiberreither.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have no objection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: No objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Thank you, Dr. Sauter. We will
consider your application in respect of documents and the witness.
We will consider your application, and we will now proceed with
the case of Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May it please the Tribunal, I should
like to make a motion to the case of Streicher. I desire to move that
Streicher’s testimony found on Pages 8495, and 8496 of April 26th
be expunged from the Record, and on Page 8549 of yesterday’s
testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, do you wish to say anything about
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me, Mr. President. Unfortunately, I did not
completely understand the motions made by the Chief Prosecutor,
Mr. Justice Jackson, because at that moment I was busy with
something else. As far as I understood, he dealt with the deletion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I can tell you what the motion was. The
motion was that passages on Pages 8494, 8495, and 8496, and on
Page 8549 be expunged from the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I understand. I would like to say, from the point of
view of the Defense, that I agree that these passages be expunged
from the record, because I am of the opinion that they are in no
way relevant for the defense of the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The passages to which Mr. Justice Jackson
has drawn our attention are, in the opinion of the Tribunal, highly
improper statements made by the Defendant Streicher. They are,
in the opinion of the Tribunal, entirely irrelevant, and they have
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
been admitted by counsel for the Defendant Streicher to be entirely
irrelevant, and they will, therefore, be expunged from the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, Dr. Marx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: May I now, with the permission of the Tribunal,
continue with the examination of witnesses? I now call the witness
Friedrich Strobel to the stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Strobel took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRIEDRICH STROBEL (Witness): Friedrich Strobel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, on 3 December 1938 were you at a meeting
of the Jurists’ association (Rechtswahrerbund) in Nuremberg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: During that meeting the Defendant Streicher is
supposed to have spoken; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Would you please tell us what the Defendant
Streicher stated on that occasion concerning the demonstrations of
9 November 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: He said, “I should not have carried out this action in
this way. In such a manner it is impossible to fight a power like
World Jewry.” Then he added, “What has been done cannot be
undone,” and some more phrases of that kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it correct that at that time you were surprised
that Streicher in public objected against that action, which had been
ordered by the highest authorities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: Yes. Streicher frequently spoke against measures and
directives of the Government when he was of a different opinion,
as on this occasion. I had the impression that apparently he had
been passed over; for in his speech there was a certain malicious
undertone to the effect that the matter was having unfavorable
aftereffects. I wondered at the time whether Streicher really had
a lucid interval and realized how harmful that anti-Jewish action
was, or whether merely his vanity was wounded, or whether he felt
that a too quick and radical an extermination of the Jews would
put an end also to his own importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, these are opinions which you are stating
and not facts; I did not ask you about that.
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: Well, that was my impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: All right, I ask you now: On 9 and 10 November
1938 were you present in Nuremberg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: Yes, I believe so. I do not remember exactly, but I
believe it was on the night of 8 to 9 November 1938 that that action
was carried out. It was on 7 November that Herr Vom Rath was
shot, and on the 8th he died, and the night after these things
occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We needn’t argue about whether it was the
8th or the 9th. It doesn’t matter, does it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The question which I want to put to you now is:
After that night during which the demonstrations against the Jewish
population took place, what observations did you make on the
following morning and later, about the attitude of the population
in Nuremberg toward these demonstrations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: I was informed about that action by the personnel
in my office. Thereupon I walked into the city and looked around
in the streets. People were standing in front of the damaged stores.
I had the impression that the vast majority of the population was
benumbed and speechless. People shook their heads, looked at each
other, muttered something, and then walked away. But, generally,
I had the impression that people could not speak aloud, and later
I heard that those who had objected to these things were treated
rather badly, when they were overheard by informers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But the general impression was, was it not, that the
population definitely disapproved of that action, and that general
indignation was recognizable though not loudly expressed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: Yes. The Russian radio at the time hit the nail on
the head by saying, “Let it be said to the credit of the German
people that they had no part in the events and that they were
sleeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact most people heard of the events of the night only on the
following morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What has this got to do with the Defendant
Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Well, the Defendant Streicher has been accused of
openly approving this action in his speech on 10 November. The
Defendant Streicher also maintains in his defense that it was an
action ordered by the top authorities and not a spontaneous demonstration
of the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The fact that a number of people in Nuremberg,
or even the whole of the people of Nuremberg, disapproved of
it wouldn’t show that Streicher disapproved of it.
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, but he maintains that there could have been no
question of an incitement, since the action had been ordered and
directed from the top, whereas, in the case of an incitement, the
action would have been started by the people themselves. That was
his conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>STROBEL: May I state my opinion about that? The action was
definitely not started by the people themselves, because even the
majority of the SA men who took part in it did so against their
will. It was an order from above; it was an organized affair. The
assertion of Dr. Goebbels that the German people had risen spontaneously
was an intentional incrimination of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I have no more questions to ask of this witness,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any other of the defendants’ counsel wish
to ask him any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: With the permission of the Tribunal, I now call the
witness Ernst Hiemer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: There is no witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is he not there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: We have no witness there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He says, Dr. Marx, that he is not there, and
that there are no witnesses there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Excuse me, Mr. President. The witness Hiemer is in
the prison here, and I talked to him personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, did you inform the prison authorities
yesterday that you were going to call him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I spoke to the Marshal on Monday and asked that
Hiemer be brought up on Tuesday, as far as I can recall. There
must be a misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, have you got any other witnesses
besides Hiemer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, the witness Wurzbacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where is he? Where is Wurzbacher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Wurzbacher is also here in prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, while he is being brought, can you take
up the time in dealing with your documents?
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. We can do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: They will be here in about 5 minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Go on, Dr. Marx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, before coming to the question of the
documents, I should like to point out the following: During the
session yesterday afternoon the Prosecution submitted several documents
which were new to me, and I have not yet had an opportunity
of stating my position with regard to them. Nor have I yet
had a chance of speaking to the Defendant Streicher about them.
From the point of view of the Defense, I consider it necessary to
explain my position with regard to these very important documents;
and I believe that I must now examine all the articles of <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span> to see whether Streicher used in some way or other the
various pieces of information from the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>;
for his defense is, “I did not believe what I read there.” If he did
not use these items of information in any of his articles, then his
answer is, to a certain extent, corroborated. Therefore I have to
review the matter...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. In one particular article it
was demonstrated yesterday in cross-examination, as I understood
it, that he had used an article from the Jewish paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. I know that article. It is one of 4 November 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Marx, what exactly are you applying
for now? What is your motion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: My motion is that the Tribunal permit me to supplement
my document book so as to be able to state my position with
regard to yesterday’s presentation of documents by the Prosecution
by submitting counter documents of my own. My presentation of
documents would be incomplete if I had no chance of replying to
these new documents submitted by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Dr. Marx; the Tribunal grants your
motion provided you make it in the ordinary way, in writing,
referring to any passages which you contend throw light on the
passages which have been put in by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes. May I now begin to discuss the individual
documents? Document Number Streicher-1 shows that the newspaper
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, according to the decision of the Führer, was
not an official Party organ and was not even entitled to carry the
state insignia while all other press organs displayed the insignia
conspicuously. That is evidence that the paper <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> was a
private publication of the Defendant Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, you are going to offer these documents
in evidence and give them exhibit numbers, are you not?
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I consider these documents as submitted; I have
discussed the subject with the Prosecution, and the Prosecution had
no objections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You see, there is a written transcript being
taken down, and unless you offer each document in evidence and
say that will be exhibit number so-and-so, it does not get into the
transcript. If you like you can do it in a group and say, “I offer in
evidence such and such documents as Exhibits 1 to 100,” or whatever
number you wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The book I have before me does contain
certain exhibit numbers; for instance, Page 1 to 4 appears to be
Exhibit Number Streicher-1 and Page 5 is Exhibit Number
Streicher-5; Page 6 is Exhibit Number Streicher-6; Page 7 is Exhibit
Number Streicher-7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am told that Page 4 is Exhibit Number
Streicher-1; is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: The pagination made here is completely different
from the one I made and consequently it is now arranged altogether
differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, let us get on. You only have to
tell us what documents you are offering in evidence and under what
exhibit numbers. Dr. Marx, you can do it later if you want to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I further submit Exhibit Number Streicher-5, an
excerpt from an editorial of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of July 1938. Number 28.
This article, which was not written by the Defendant Streicher but
by Karl Holz, is worded in very sharp language and says that
vengeance will break loose one day and all Jewry will be exterminated.
But the salient point here—the article seems to have been
provoked by a letter which was sent from Nuremberg to New York,
and which stated that Germany in the case of war, would be
destroyed from the air. And so this article also falls under the
claim which the defendant made yesterday, namely that his sharp
language was always caused by some preceding action from another
side. That is Document Number Streicher-5 and I ask permission to
submit it as an exhibit under that number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I submit as Document Number Streicher-6, an excerpt
from Number 40 of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of October 1938. I think I can
dispense with comment on it because my argument can be seen
from the document itself; or is it necessary to speak about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, you need not speak about them; just put
them in.
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I submit as Document Number Streicher-7, an excerpt
from the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> of 25 February 1942, in answer
to Document M-31 of the trial brief against the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I submit Document Number Streicher-8, an excerpt from
the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> of 8 February 1939, Page 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as Document Number Streicher-9, an excerpt from the
political testament of Adolf Hitler, dated 29 April 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Document Number Streicher-10, an excerpt from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>,
February 1935, Number 8, Page 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Document Number Streicher-11, an excerpt from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
of September 1935, Number 38.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am giving the next page the Document Number Streicher-12.
That is an excerpt from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, of September 1935, Number
38, Page 9.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number Streicher-13 is an excerpt from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>,
of January 1938. Number 1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number Streicher-14, an excerpt from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
of May 1938, Number 20.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Document Number Streicher-15, an excerpt from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
of 5 November 1943, Number 45.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Document Number Streicher-16, of the Defense, a document
submitted by the Prosecution under number 759-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Document Number Streicher-17, speeches made by Himmler
in April 1943, on 4 October 1943, and 23 September 1943 at Posen
and Kharkov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Document Number Streicher-18, a photostat of the special
issue of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> of May 1939, Number 20.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ask to have these documents admitted. I have limited myself
to the utmost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is all, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are the witnesses ready yet? Perhaps we
might as well adjourn for 10 minutes now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Ernst Hiemer took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ERNST HIEMER (Witness): Ernst Hiemer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: May I just interrupt for a minute, Mr. President.
First of all I would like to state that I am by no means holding
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
the Marshal responsible for the mistake. The matter was as follows:
The mistake in requesting the witness...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is quite all right, Dr. Marx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I consider it my duty to state here that the Marshal
is not responsible for the mistake about the bringing in of the
witness. One of my assistants spoke yesterday with a gentleman...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We quite understand, Dr. Marx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then, Mr. President, I should like to submit Documents
Number Streicher 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 up to 18. I do not know
whether it is clear now. The numbers are 1 and 5, and from 6
through 18. Lacking are 2, 3, and 4, which were dropped. All other
exhibit numbers are contained therein, Numbers 1 and from 5
through 18.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You include 19, don’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: No, Numbers 19 and 20 are not necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, I beg your pardon. I think I must have
been wrong. I have taken down 19, but you haven’t got 19, have
you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Number 18 is my last one, Your Honor, and I ask to
have that included in the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And now you are going to go on with the
witnesses?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ERNST HIEMER: Ernst Hiemer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Since when have you known Herr Streicher, how
did you get into contact with him, and what position did you have
on <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: At the end of 1934 I was introduced to the then Gauleiter
Julius Streicher in the Deutscher Hof in Nuremberg. Streicher
gave me the assignment of working for his public health journal,
<span class='it'>Die Deutsche Volksgesundheit</span>. In 1935 I also wrote reports for
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. Streicher then had me transferred to the editorial
staff of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Eventually, under Streicher’s direction and the direction of other
staff members of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, I did editorial work as a co-editor.
The responsible editor of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> was Karl Holz, Streicher’s
deputy, but the leading spirit of the paper was Streicher himself.
In the year 1938 instructions came from Berlin to the effect that
Holz was permitted to contribute to <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, but in his capacity
as state official—he was the Deputy Gauleiter—he was no longer
to be mentioned in the editions of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. Thereupon, on
instruction from Streicher, my name was entered in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
as responsible editor. The overall direction of the paper and all
authority connected therewith remained in Streicher’s hands, and
Streicher retained this position until the collapse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What was the main idea of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer’s</span> policy?
What was the Leitmotiv?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Streicher wanted by means of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, in the
simplest and most popular language, to convey to every man and
every woman of the German nation knowledge about the Jews.
Streicher wanted the entire German people to realize that the Jew
was a stranger among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Herr Hiemer, I do not want to know that. I want
you to tell me whether Herr Streicher, let us say, wished to advocate
emigration or whether he followed a different train of thought.
Long expositions on the Jewish problem are not required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Streicher was of the opinion that in Germany the
Jewish question should be solved by emigration. He repeatedly
criticized the leadership of the Reich because the emigration of
Jews was not being carried through in the manner desired by
Streicher. When the war came, Streicher asserted that the Jewish
problem would no longer have had any significance for a Germany
at war if in accordance with his idea it had been solved by complete
emigration of the Jews during the preceding time of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Is it correct that the Palestine and Madagascar
problem was discussed in the journal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Yes. Streicher stated his opinion in word as well as
in writing, that Palestine and Madagascar would be suitable localities
for absorbing the Jews living in Germany. However, he did
not follow up this thought, since not Germany but only England
and France could dispose of Palestine and Madagascar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What do you think about the influence exerted by
Streicher and <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> since 1933? Is it not true that since 1933
its influence among the German people was much in decline?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Yes, that is correct. In many circles it was known
that the influence of Streicher and of his paper on the movement
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>
did decrease. After 1933 Streicher had many conflicts with other
Party leaders, and he made many enemies. Particularly from the
year 1937, Streicher was pushed more and more into the background.
Within the Party the Institute for the Study of the Jewish
Problem, under the leadership of Rosenberg, dealt with the theory
of the Jewish problem, and actual authority over the Jews belonged,
as is well known, exclusively to Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When finally in the year 1940 Streicher was relieved of his post
as Gauleiter, he was completely isolated. From then on he lived
on his farm and worked there as a farmer; he wrote articles only
for <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What was the circulation of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> from
1933? Can you give us figures? Of course, only after the date when
you joined the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: This question of the circulation could, of course, be
answered best by the publication manager, who was concerned
with it. However, I remember approximate figures. <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
was in 1933 a very small paper; but by the year 1935 its circulation
increased to about 800,000. After that, however, there was a sharp
decline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, during the war <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> had a smaller circulation.
I cannot give you any exact figures and during the last months the
circulation of the paper was, of course, extremely small. On the
average, I might say that <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> had a circulation of perhaps
half a million. Of course, there were special issues which had a
much larger circulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I said, only the publisher could authenticate these figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What can be the reason for the increase in the
year 1935?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: It is very difficult for me to answer that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Wasn’t it because Party authorities—because subscriptions
were made compulsory in factories and other places?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: You are putting questions to me which really only a
publisher can answer. I myself cannot answer the question with
assurance, and therefore must remain silent; my testimony would
not be reliable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Of course, if you don’t know, you are free to say,
“My knowledge on this point is not sufficient.” Did Herr Streicher
know of the happenings in the East, especially in the concentration
camps, and what did he personally tell you about these things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Streicher himself never told me that he knew about
the happenings in the concentration camps. On the contrary,
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>
Streicher said he learned of these things only in 1944 through the
Swiss press. Streicher received the Swiss newspapers regularly, in
particular the <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> of Switzerland, and in
1944 this journal published rather detailed descriptions about what
was going on in the concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher at first refused to credit these reports in the Swiss
press and called them premeditated lies. He declared that these
reports were being printed merely for the purpose of undermining
the prestige of the German people abroad. It is true Streicher soon
changed his opinion. He began to doubt that his opinion was right
and finally he believed that the occurrences in concentration camps,
as pictured in the Swiss press, did after all correspond to the facts.
Streicher said that Himmler was the only man who could have
authorized such crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: You said that Streicher soon changed his opinion.
What does that mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: In the beginning he had decidedly said that these
reports could not be true. Then he became uncertain and said that
perhaps they might be true. I had the impression that either the
detailed manner of the reports in the Swiss press had convinced
Streicher that these things had actually occurred or that Streicher,
from one source or another, either through personal contact or
through letters, had received knowledge that these happenings were
actually taking place in the concentration camps. To that I ascribe
his change of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And when was that, approximately?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: I cannot give you the exact date, but I believe it was
in the middle of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What attitude did he take when he was finally
convinced? Did he express satisfaction at the fact that so many
people had been killed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: No. Streicher definitely deprecated what was done in
the concentration camps. It did happen that Streicher, in anger—if
he had been especially upset by political events—often or at times,
asserted that Jews, as an enemy of the German people, should be
exterminated. However, Streicher talked in that way only in the
first phase of excitement. When he was calmed, he always opposed
the extermination of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But repeatedly in articles of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> there is
talk of the extermination of the Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Yes. It is a fact that in reports of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> the
extermination of Jewry is spoken about. However, on the other
hand, Streicher again and again opposed the murder of the Jews,
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
and I am quite convinced that Streicher and <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> had
nothing whatever to do with the happenings in concentration camps.
I do not believe it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it is known now that these crimes in the concentration
camps were committed on the instructions of individual leading
men; that is, on official orders, and it is my firm conviction that
neither Streicher nor <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> had anything to do with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: How were the articles which you wrote prepared?
Did you receive directives for the articles from Streicher and then
merely edit them, or were you the real author?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Streicher was the founder and the publisher of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. But he was in fact also the chief editor, and all his
colleagues, no matter whether it was his deputy, Holz, or others—all
of them had to submit their articles to Streicher before they
were printed. Streicher then ordered changes if the need arose;
he also gave the editors assignments for articles, that is, he told
them with what arguments these articles were to be drawn up;
and Streicher knew of all the articles which appeared in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
In fact, he was the responsible head, the editor of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.
All others were his assistants. He himself was, as he often said with
pride, one and the same with <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. “Streicher and
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> are one and the same.” That was his maxim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: That, of course, he admits; he says that he assumes
the responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What can you tell us about the so-called pornographic library?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> was in possession of a large archive.
This archive consisted of many thousands of German and foreign-language
books, documents, edicts, and so forth. These books were
either put at the disposal of the <span class='it'>Stürmer</span> archive by friends of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, or they came from Jewish apartments. The police
put books which were found in Jewish houses at the disposal of
Rosenberg’s Institute for the Study of the Jewish problem for
research purposes. Whatever remained in the Jewish dwellings in
Nuremberg was turned over to the <span class='it'>Stürmer</span> archive. Among these
books there were also numerous which dealt with sexual knowledge,
books by Magnus Hirschfeld, Bloch, and some which were simply
pornographic. These, then, consisted both of books which had been
sent in by friends of the <span class='it'>Stürmer</span>, and books which had been found
in Jewish dwellings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These books were kept in a special section of the <span class='it'>Stürmer</span>
archive under lock and key, and the public did not have access to
them. This literature was no personal pornographic library of
Streicher, but formed a part of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer’s</span> archive. Streicher
never read these books. They were to be reviewed after the war in
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
the course of the reconstruction. All those which were not of direct
Jewish origin were to be removed, but as I said, Streicher did not
read these books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Where were these books kept? Were they in the
publishing house, or how is it that a part...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Marx, there is no charge here with respect
to this particular sort of books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: This is my last question. I just wanted to clarify
this matter, since it played an important part in the public mind.
I have no further questions to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then, are there any questions from the other
Defense Counsel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED THOMA (Counsel for Defendant Rosenberg): I
have one question only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Did Rosenberg have any connections
with the editorial staff of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: To my knowledge, his connections were almost non-existent.
I knew personally only Dr. Ballensiefen, who worked with
Rosenberg. I also knew Dr. Pohl personally, but no relations existed
between the <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> and the Institute for the Study of the
Jewish Problem for the purposes of co-operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Did Ballensiefen and Pohl have connections with
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Pohl had personal connections with me. He was a
student of Hebrew and had made translations of the Talmud; he
had also published the <span class='it'>Talmudgeist</span>. Through that I got to know
him. Ballensiefen also had no personal connection with <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Does this mean that Pohl did have personal connections...</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Only with me, not with <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: ...or was he sent by Rosenberg in this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: I have no further questions, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I have only one matter to ask
you about. Do I understand you to say that by the middle of 1944
Streicher had become convinced that the reports in the Swiss newspaper,
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>, were true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: I did not understand you. Will you please repeat the
question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Do I understand you to say that
by the middle of 1944 Streicher had become convinced of the truth
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>
of the reports he was reading in the Swiss newspaper about concentration
camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Yes, I had the impression that Streicher in the middle
of 1944...</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I only wanted an answer “yes”
or “no.” That is quite sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me just read to you three lines of an article which was
published in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> on the 14th of September 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Bolshevism cannot be vanquished; it must be destroyed.
The same is true of Judaism; it cannot be vanquished, disarmed,
or rendered powerless; it must be exterminated.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is Page 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the word that you use or is cited for exterminated is ausgerottet,
which I understand means completely wiped out. Why
was that article appearing in <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> in September 1944, when
it was known by the owner of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> what was going on in
concentration camps in the East? What was the purpose of that
article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: I personally did not write this article. I believe that
Streicher wrote it, therefore I myself am not able to judge the
intention of the article. But I do maintain that Streicher made
statements opposing the murders in the concentration camps, and
that he did not want the murder of Jewry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Very well, I will leave that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, in the interest of time I do not propose to cross-examine
this witness any further. Perhaps I might be allowed to
draw the Tribunal’s attention to those articles contained in your
bundle, which are articles actually written by this witness. There
are about seven of them. Page 3A, 35A, 38A, 40A, 49A, 50A and 51A,
that is, covering a period from January 1939 up to August 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, My Lord, the other matter that I would draw the Tribunal’s
attention to was that this witness was the author of the disgusting
children’s book which I presented to the Tribunal in putting
the individual case against Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there any further cross-examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Marx, do you wish to re-examine? You heard what counsel
said about the various articles written by this witness. You wish
to re-examine or not? Have you any questions you wish to ask the
witness?
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Hiemer, perhaps you did not quite understand the question
a moment ago. Please tell us again just when Herr Streicher received
knowledge, and when he told you that he was convinced of
or believed in these mass murders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: It is my opinion and conviction that it was in the
middle of 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But there had been statements to that effect in the
<span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span> for a number of years prior to that date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>HIEMER: Yes; at that time Streicher did not believe these
things. His change of view took place only in the year 1944 and I
remember it was not before the middle of the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I have no further questions to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: With the permission of the Tribunal I would like
to call the witness Philipp Wurzbacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Wurzbacher took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PHILIPP WURZBACHER (Witness): Philipp Wurzbacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath in German.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, you were an SA Leader in Nuremberg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: From when?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: From 1928.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And what position did you have?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: At that time I was an SA Standartenführer
and had risen from the lowest ranks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Witness, please speak more slowly and pause as
frequently as possible, as your testimony has to be interpreted into
several languages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long have you known the Defendant Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: I have known him from meetings, since 1923;
personally, from the time of my activity as an SA Leader in the
year 1928.
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were you regularly present at the meetings at
which Streicher spoke?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: I cannot say that I was present regularly, but
I attended very frequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did Streicher in his speeches advocate the use of
violence against the Jewish population, or did he predict it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: At no meeting did I hear suggestions that
violence should be used against the Jewish population. Nor did I
ever hear Streicher suggest or announce that he had any such intentions
in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did an act of violence against the Jewish population,
originating from and carried out by the people themselves,
take place in Nuremberg or the Gau Franconia at any time in the
period from 1920 to 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: No, I cannot remember any incident of that
type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did the SA undertake any such action or was anything
like that ordered?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: The SA never undertook anything like that at
that time. On the contrary, the SA had instructions, unequivocal
instructions, to refrain from such acts of violence. Severe punishment
would have resulted for anyone who did anything like that,
or for an SA Leader who gave such orders. Besides, as I have
already emphasized, there was never any suggestion or any order
to that effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What do you say to the events on the night of the
9 to 10 November 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: I was not in Nuremberg during the events
from the 9 to 10 November 1938. At that time I was in Bad Ems
on account of chronic laryngitis. I can only say what I know from
stories which I heard afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you talk with Obergruppenführer Obernitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: About these events?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Yes, I talked with SA Obergruppenführer
Von Obernitz in a brief conversation, when I reported my return.
We spoke only a few words, since Obergruppenführer Von Obernitz
was called away so that in the course of the conversation I could
not return to the subject. I remember that Obergruppenführer
Von Obernitz declared at the time that as far as he was concerned
the matter had been put in order. That was the sense of what he
said.
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was there within the SA a uniform opinion, or were
there, even in the circles of the SA, men who disapproved of these
incredible occurrences?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Opinions were, as far as I could determine
upon my return—I believe it was on 23 or 24 November—very
much divided. A part of the SA was in favor, the other opposed
what had happened, but at all events, the majority in general considered
it to be wrong and condemned what had been done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was there an increase, I mean, an increase of
brutality in these circles after 1933 on account of the growing
numbers of the SA?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: It goes without saying that after the accession
to power, when many doubtful elements joined, the situation was
completely different from what it had been before. Up to that time,
as a responsible Leader, one knew almost every member individually,
but now with the tremendous influx of new men, a general
survey of the new situation had first to be made. But I believe I
may say that an increase of brutality did not occur. Perhaps some
undesirable elements which, in the name of the SA, did this or that,
had slipped in but in general I cannot say that an overall increase
of brutality took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you conclude that <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> exerted an influence
in the SA with the result that an anti-Semitic tendency
made itself felt among the men under your command? Did you
not read a different publication, <span class='it'>Der SA Mann</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> had a very divided reception, I
might say, especially among the people in Nuremberg and in particular
in the SA. There were large numbers in the SA who, if
they did not exactly reject <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, were in fact not interested
because of the tedious repetitions contained in it, and for
this reason the paper was of no importance to them. Moreover,
it was natural that members of the SA read their own paper,
<span class='it'>Der SA Mann</span>, first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: When you attended a meeting in which Streicher
spoke, what impression did you gain of the objectives which he
pursued in his speech with regard to the solution of the Jewish
problem?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: The objectives which were stated by Streicher
were, I should say, unequivocal and clear. He pursued the policy
that the strong elements of the Jewish people which occupied
positions in the German economy and above all in public life and
public offices should be removed and that necessarily, expulsion
or emigration should be considered.
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Did you participate in the boycott on 1 April 1933
in any way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Yes, I participated in the boycott. At that
time I had instructions from my Gruppenführer to see to it that this
boycott should be kept within the limits of order and propriety,
and that in this way the success of the boycott would be assured.
I instructed the Sturmführer under my command to assign to each
department store a guard of two SA men who were to see to it that
nothing happened and everything took its course in an orderly
and unobjectionable fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were there not instructions from Streicher also?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Yes. The instructions which I received from my
Gruppenführer had been issued by Gauleiter Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Were attacks on Jews not to be prevented by all
means?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: That was so not only in this one case, but in
all cases. It was repeatedly pointed out that we were to refrain
from attacks or unauthorized acts of violence or other hostile acts
against the Jewish people or Jewish individuals, especially in
Nuremberg, and that it was strictly prohibited...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: What was Streicher’s reaction when he heard that
nevertheless such acts of violence had been perpetrated by
individuals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: I can cite one example in which violence was
used. I believe it was a small scuffle, at any rate, something had
happened, but I do not recall the details of the case. In any event,
he called us very sharply to account, and we SA leaders were
severely reprimanded and rebuked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And what did he say? Did he make a general
statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: If I may give the essence of it, he said that he
would not tolerate that human beings be beaten or molested in
any way in his Gau, and for the SA leaders he had rather drastic
expressions such as ruffians or similar names—I do not recall them
exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: But he was called the Bloody Czar of Franconia.
How is that to be explained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: Perhaps it was his manner, the way he behaved
at times. Sometimes he could be very harsh and outspoken. At any
rate I can only say that during my activity I did not experience
anything or hear anything suggesting that he was a “bloody czar.”
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know what his attitude was toward concentration
camps? Did he visit Dachau? If so, how often, and what
did he do about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: I cannot give you any information on that
point. I know just one thing and that is that he said repeatedly
that people who had been taken to Dachau should be freed as soon
as possible if there was no criminal or other charge against them.
I also know of several cases of release very soon after the arrest of
the people or their removal to a concentration camp. For example
the teacher Matt, who was an old adversary of his in the Town Hall
of Nuremberg, was released after a very short time—I believe three
or four months. Another man, a certain Defender, who had been
active primarily in labor unions, was also released after a very
short period of time. If I remember correctly, it was about the year
1935 or perhaps the beginning of 1936—I do not know exactly—when
the last inmates left the camp at Dachau and were greeted
with music upon their return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Was it not held against him that he freed so many
members of the left-wing parties from Dachau?</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: It was said here and there by members of the
SA that the Gauleiter’s action could hardly be justified, that he
took too light a view of these things and so on, but we also pointed
out that after all the Gauleiter bore the responsibility and that he
ought to know just what he had to do in this or that case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Do you know that Himmler told Streicher of his
displeasure at these releases and said that disciplinary action would
be taken against him if he continued with them? If you know
nothing about this matter, please say: “No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>WURZBACHER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Then I have concluded my questioning of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any member of the Defense Counsel
wish to ask questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, no questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness left the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does that conclude your case, Dr. Marx?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, Your Honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then we go on with Dr. Schacht’s case next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I begin my presentation of evidence with the calling
of Dr. Schacht as a witness, and I ask Your Lordship to permit
Dr. Schacht to enter the witness box.
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Schacht took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HJALMAR SCHACHT (Defendant): Hjalmar Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Please tell the Tribunal briefly about your descent?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The families of both my parents have lived for centuries
in Schleswig-Holstein, which until 1864 belonged to Denmark.
My parents were both born as Danish citizens. After the annexation
by Germany my father emigrated to the United States, where three
of his older brothers had already emigrated, and he became an
American citizen. My two brothers, who were older than I, were
born there. Later my mother’s health prompted my father’s return
to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was educated in Hamburg. I studied at universities in Germany
and in Paris, and after receiving my doctor’s degree I was active
for 2 years in economic organizations. Then I began my banking
career, and for 13 years I was at the Dresdner Bank, one of the
large so-called “D” banks. I then took over the management of a
bank of my own, which was later merged with one of the “D”
banks, and in 1923 I abandoned my private career and went into
public service as Commissioner for German Currency (Reichswährungskommissar).
Soon afterwards I became President of the
Reichsbank, and I held that office until 1930, when I resigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Why did you resign as President of the Reichsbank at
that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In two essential points there were differences of
opinion between the Government and me; one was the internal
finance policy of the Government. With the terrible catastrophe of
the lost war and the Dictate of Versailles behind us, it was necessary
in my opinion to use thrifty and modest methods in German politics.
The democratic and socialist governments of that period could not
see that point, but carried on an irresponsible financial policy, especially
by incurring debts which in particular were contracted to a
very large extent abroad. It was quite clear that Germany, already
heavily burdened with reparation payments, was under no circumstances
in a position to build up as much foreign currency as was
necessary for the payment of these debts. We were not even able
to pay the reparations from our own economy.
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore I objected to the contraction of these debts in which
the various governments of that period indulged, and to which they
also encouraged communities and private companies. I objected to
this financial policy and continually, abroad and at home, warned
against such a policy of incurring foreign debts. The foreign bankers
did not listen nor did the German Government. It was during
that period that if in Berlin one passed the Adlon Hotel, Unter Den
Linden, one could not be sure that a financial agent would not
emerge and ask whether one did not need a loan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later I was strongly opposed by these same people, when Germany
was forced to discontinue making payments of her debts. But
I wish to state here that I have always and on every occasion been
against such a policy of debts. That was the one reason. The other
reason was in the field of foreign policy. I had not only contributed
my part toward the creation of the Young Plan but in 1929 I also
assisted in the setting up of the Young Committee; the so-called
Young Plan had resulted in a number of improvements for Germany,
which the German Government was now sacrificing step by
step during the subsequent negotiations at The Hague. Thus the
financial and economic condition of the nation again deteriorated.
I revolted against this, and for both these reasons I resigned my
office as Reichsbankpräsident in protest, in March 1930.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Gentlemen of the Tribunal, in this connection, may I
call your attention to Exhibit Number Schacht-6 of my Document
Book. If the Tribunal agrees, I should like, in order to shorten the
presentation of documents during the examination of the witness,
to call your attention to those documents which have a direct connection
with the questions with which the witness is dealing. I
believe that this arrangement will be agreeable to the Tribunal
since it will shorten the presentation of documents. It is Document
Number Schacht-6, on Page 12 of the German copy of my document
book and on Page 8 of the English copy, Your Lordship, Exhibit
Number Schacht-6. That is a record of the statements made by
Dr. Schacht during the session of the subcommittee for monetary
and credit matters on 21 October 1926. I believe it is not necessary
for me to read these statements. They refer to the foreign debts
which Dr. Schacht has just mentioned, and contain the same
thoughts which Dr. Schacht has just expressed before the Tribunal,
and are proof that these thoughts are not views <span class='it'>ex post facto</span>.
Therefore, without reading it, I ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of the whole of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall return to my examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] You had resigned your office as President
of the Reichsbank. What did you do then?
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I went to the small estate which I owned in the
country and lived there as a private citizen. Then in 1930 I made a
trip to the United States. I departed shortly or immediately after
the Reichstag elections of September 1930 and went to New York via
London. There I lectured for about two months on questions which
were presented to me by American friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When did you first get in touch with the National
Socialist ideology, with the Party, and with Hitler personally, and
when, in particular, did you read the Party program and Hitler’s
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: With the exception of a single occasion I have never
in my life concerned myself with Party politics. Even at the age of
26 I was offered a sure electoral district in the Reichstag, which I
did not accept, since I have never been interested in Party politics.
My interest always lay in the field of economics and financial policy
but, of course, for public affairs I always had a general interest,
arising from a concern for the future of my country and my people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, in 1919, I participated in the foundation of the Democratic
Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I say a few words here about my background and spiritual
upbringing? My father, throughout his life, adhered to democratic
ideals. He was a Freemason. He was a cosmopolitan. I had, and
I still have, numerous relatives on my mother’s side in Denmark
and on my father’s side in the United States, and to this day I am
on friendly terms with them. I grew up among these ideas and I
have never departed from these basic conceptions of Freemasonry
and democracy and humanitarian and cosmopolitan ideals. Later
I always remained in very close contact with foreign countries.
I traveled much, and with the exception of Ireland and Finland
there is no country in Europe which I have not visited. I know Asia
down to India, Ceylon, and Burma. I went to North America frequently,
and just before the Second World War broke out I intended
to travel to South America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to emphasize this in order to show that I was never
interested in Party politics. Nevertheless, when in the elections of
September 1930 Hitler’s party suddenly and surprisingly obtained
108 seats, I began to take an interest in the phenomenon; and on
board ship going to the United States I read <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> and, of
course, also the Party program. When I arrived on the other side
the first question was what was my opinion about Hitler and the
Party, because naturally everyone was talking about this event in
Germany. In my first publication at that time—it was an interview—I
uttered an unequivocal warning and said, “If you people
abroad do not change your policy towards Germany, then you will
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span>
soon have very many more adherents of Hitler in Germany than
there are now.” Throughout that period of 2 months I spoke about
50 times in public meetings, and I always met with understanding
in the question of reparations, the mistakes of the Versailles Treaty,
and the economic difficulties of Germany, and I returned with the
impression that the whole American attitude, the attitude of the
American people toward us, was indeed rather friendly. Not on my
initiative but by coincidence, I got in touch with the adherents of
the National Socialist Party. A friend of mine, a bank director,
invited me at the beginning of December 1930 to dine with him at
his house and to meet Hermann Göring there. I did so and gained
no really definite impression from Göring’s statements and conduct.
He was in every respect reserved, modest, and well-mannered, and
he invited me to his house in order to meet Hitler. At the beginning
of January my wife and I dined with Göring and his wife one
evening at their home, and on that occasion, Fritz Thyssen was also
invited. It had been planned that Hitler should come also and talk
with us. I say again now that Göring’s apartment was extremely
modestly and simply styled. We had a plain pea soup and bacon
and particularly Göring’s first wife made an excellent impression.
After supper Hitler appeared, and the ensuing conversation was
conducted in such a way that, let us say, 5 percent of it was contributed
by us, and 95 percent by Hitler. What he said concerned
national questions, in which he agreed absolutely with us. No
extravagant demands were stated, but on the other hand the
national necessities of Germany were definitely emphasized. In
social questions Hitler expressed a number of good ideas; he was
especially intent on avoiding class struggle and on eliminating
strikes, lock-outs, and wage disputes by decisive intervention of the
State in labor relations and the direction of economic affairs. There
was no demand for abolishing private enterprise, but merely for
influence in its conduct. It seemed to us these ideas were quite
reasonable and acceptable. Aside from that, he revealed practically
no knowledge in the field of economy and financial policy, though
on that evening he did not claim to know anything about these
subjects. He merely asked that we as representatives of economy
should have understanding for his ideas and give him factual advice.
That was the purpose of that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I shall refer to this first conversation with Adolf Hitler
later, but I should like to return now to the question I have put
before concerning your attitude to the Party program and the
ideology developed in the book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>. I am stressing this
because, as you have heard, the gentlemen of the Prosecution are
of the opinion that certain parts of the Party program as such and
also parts of the book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, are of a criminal character, and
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>
that their criminal character was recognizable immediately upon
their publication. Therefore I should like to ask you to explain in
detail your attitude at the time, and possibly also your attitude
today, toward the Party program and the ideology of National
Socialism as it appears in the book <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: From the proceedings in this Court so far I have not
gained the impression that the opinion of the Prosecution concerning
the criminal character of the Party program is a uniform
one. I am unable to see in the Party program as such any sign of
criminal intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Federation of all Germans, which always plays a great role, is
always claimed only on the basis of the right for self-determination.
A position for Germany in foreign politics is demanded as constituting
equality of the German nation with the other nations;
that this involved the abolition of the discriminations which were
imposed upon the German people by the Versailles Treaty is quite
clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Land and soil was demanded for the nutrition of our people and
the settlement of our excess population. I cannot see any crime in
that, because after land and soil was expressly added in brackets
the word “colonies.” I have always considered that as a demand
for colonies, which I myself supported a long time before National
Socialism came into existence. Rather strange and, in my opinion,
going somewhat beyond the limits were the points concerning the
exclusion of Jews from civil rights, but on the other hand it was
reassuring that the Jews were to be under the protection of the
Aliens’ Law, that is, subject to the same laws which applied to
foreigners in Germany. I would have wished and always demanded
that this legal protection should under all circumstances be given
to the Jews. Unfortunately they were not given that protection.
For the rest it was emphasized that all citizens should have equal
rights and duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Promotion of popular education was stressed as being beneficial,
and also gymnastics and sports were demanded for the improvement
of public health. The fight against deliberate political lies
was demanded, which Goebbels afterwards conducted very energetically.
And, above all, demand was made for the freedom of all
religious denominations and for the principle of positive Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is, in essence, the content of the National Socialist Party
program, and I cannot see anything criminal in it. It would, indeed,
have been quite peculiar if, had this been a criminal Party program,
the world had maintained continuous political and cultural
contact with Germany for two decades, and with the National
Socialists for one decade.
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the book, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, is concerned, my judgment has
always been the same from the very beginning as it is today. It
is a book written in the worst kind of German, propaganda of a
man who was strongly interested in politics, not to say a fanatical,
half educated man, which to me Hitler has always been. In the book
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> and in part also in the Party program there was one
point which worried me a great deal, and that was the absolute
lack of understanding for all economic problems. The Party program
contained a few slogans, such as “Community interests come
before private interests,” and so on, and then the “breaking up of
subjection to financial interests” and similar phrases which could
not possibly signify anything sensible. The same held true for
<span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, which is of no interest from the point of view of
economic policy and consequently had no interest for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, as regards foreign policy <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> contained,
in my opinion, a great many mistakes, because it always
toyed with the idea that within the continent of Europe the living
space for Germany ought to be extended. And if nevertheless I
did co-operate later on with a National Socialist Reich Chancellor,
then it was for the very simple reason that expansion of the German
space toward the East was in the book made specifically dependent
upon the approval of the British Government. Therefore, to me,
believing that I knew British policy very well, this seemed Utopian
and there was no danger of my taking these theoretical extravagances
of Hitler any more seriously than I did. It was clear to me
that every territorial change on European territory attempted by
force would be impossible for Germany, and would not be approved
by the other nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides that, <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> had a number of very silly and verbose
statements but, on the other hand, it had many a reasonable
idea, too; I want to point out that I liked two things especially:
first, that anyone who differs with the government in political
matters is obliged to state his opinion to the government; and
secondly, that, though the democratic or rather parliamentary
government ought to be replaced by a Führer government, nevertheless
the Führer could only remain if he was sure of the approval
of the entire people, in other words, that a Führer also depended
on plebiscites of a democratic nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Schacht, you have now described the impression
which you gained from your first conversation with Adolf Hitler,
as well as from a study of the Party program and <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.
Did you believe that you would be able to work with Adolf Hitler
and what practical conclusions did you derive from that first conversation
with Hitler?
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: To work with Adolf Hitler was out of the question
for me personally, since I was a private citizen and not interested
in Party politics and consequently after that conversation I did
nothing at all to create for myself any personal relations with the
Hitler circles. I simply went back to my farm and I continued to
live there as a private citizen. So personally, for myself I did not
draw any conclusions but I drew another conclusion. I have
already said that naturally I had the future of my country at heart.
After that conversation I repeatedly emphasized to Reich Chancellor
Brüning and implored him when forming and heading the Cabinet
to include the National Socialists in it, because I believed that only
in this way the tremendous impetus, the tremendous propagandistic
fervor which I had noticed in Hitler, could be caught and harnessed—by
putting the National Socialists to practical government
work. One should not leave them in the opposition where they
could only become more dangerous, but one should take them into
the government and see what they could achieve and whether they
would not acquire polish within the government. That was the
suggestion and the very urgent request I made to Brüning, and I
might say that according to my impression Hitler would at that
time have been quite ready to do that. Brüning could under no
circumstances be won over to such a policy and in consequence was
later crushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Let us stop for a moment and deal with the Party.
The Indictment states that you were a Party member. Now, Göring
has already said that Hitler conferred the Golden Party Emblem
only as a sort of decoration. Do you have anything new to add to
that statement made by Göring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know whether it has been mentioned here;
the Golden Party Emblem was in January 1937 given to all Ministers
and also to all military personalities in the Cabinet. The latter
could not become Party members at all; therefore the award of the
Party emblem did not entail membership. As to the rest I think
Göring has testified from the witness stand. I might mention one
more thing. If I had been a Party member, then doubtlessly when
I was ousted from my position as Minister without Portfolio in
January 1943, the Party Court would have gone into action, since a
case of insubordination to Hitler would have been evident. I was
never before the Party Court and even when on the occasion of my
dismissal the return of the Golden Party Emblem was demanded
from me, I was not told that I was being dismissed from the Party,
since I was not in the Party. I was only told “return the Golden
Emblem of the Party which was conferred upon you,” and I
promptly complied.
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe I could not add anything else to the statements already
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then the Indictment is wrong in this point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes; in this point it is absolutely wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Why did you not become a Party member?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Excuse me, but I was opposed to quite a number
of points of the National Socialist ideology. I do not believe that it
would have been compatible with my entirely democratic attitude
to change over to a different Party program, and one which, not in
its wording but through its execution by the Party had certainly
not—in the course of time—gained any more favor with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Therefore, you did not become a Party member for
reasons of principle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, for reasons of principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, a biography of you was published by one
Dr. Reuther in 1937. There, also, it is correctly stated that you
were not a Party member; but the biographer gives different, more
tactical reasons for your refusing to join the Party; and he mentions
the possibility of being more influential from outside the Party
and so on. Maybe it is advisable, since the biography has been
referred to in the course of the proceedings, that you shortly state
your views on this point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I believe that at the time Hitler had the impression
that I could be useful to him outside of the Party and it may be
that Dr. Reuther got knowledge of this. But I would rather not
be made responsible for the writings of Dr. Reuther, and in particular
I should like to object to the fact that the Prosecutor who
presented the brief against me described this book by Dr. Reuther
as an official publication. Of course this book is the private work
of a journalist for whom I have respect but who certainly states
his own opinions and ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you speak in public on behalf of Hitler before
the July elections in 1932?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Before the July elections of 1932, which brought
that tremendous success for Hitler, I was never active either
publicly or privately on behalf of Hitler, except once, perhaps, or
twice—I remember now, it happened once—Hitler sent a Party
member to me who had plans on economic, financial, or currency
policies; Hitler may have told him that he should consult me as to
whether or not these plans could be put into practice. I might tell
the story briefly: It was Gauleiter Röwer of Oldenburg. In Oldenburg
the Nazis had already come to power before 1932 and he
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>
was the Minister President there. He wanted to introduce an
Oldenburg currency of its own, a consequence of which would have
been that Saxony would have introduced its own Saxon currency,
Württemberg would have introduced its own currency, and Baden
would have had its own currency, and so on. I ridiculed the whole
thing at the time and sent a telegram to Hitler, saying that the
economic needs of the German Reich could not be cured by such
miracles. If I disregard this case, which might have constituted some
sort of private connection, then I may say that neither privately nor
publicly, neither in speeches nor in writing, have I at all been concerned
with Hitler or his Party and in no way have I recommended
the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you vote National Socialist in July 1932?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, I would not think of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution now lists a number of points by which
it wants to prove that you were an adherent of the National
Socialist ideology. I am going to name them one by one, and I ask
you to state your view on each of them. First, that you were an
opponent of the Treaty of Versailles. Would you like to say something
about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It surprised me indeed to hear that reproach from
an American Prosecutor. The lieutenant who spoke is perhaps too
young to have experienced it himself, but he should know it from
his education; at any rate, for all of us who have lived through
that time, it was one of the outstanding events that the Treaty of
Versailles was rejected by the United States, and, if I am not
wrong, rejected with the resounding approval of the entire American
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reasons prompting that action were also my reasons for
rejecting the Treaty: it stood in contradiction to the Fourteen
Points of Wilson, which had been solemnly agreed upon, and in the
field of economics it contained absurdities which certainly could
not work out to the advantage of world economy. But I certainly
would not accuse the American people of having been adherents
of the Nazi ideology, because they rejected the Treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution also assert that you had already
been for a long time a German National Socialist, not merely a
German patriot, but a German nationalist and expansionist. Would
you like to state your position in that respect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: You, yourself, by emphasizing the word “patriot”
have recognized that one must be clear on just what a nationalist
is. I have always been proud to belong to a nation which for more
than a thousand years has been one of the leading civilized nations
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
of the world. I was proud to belong to a nation which has given
to the world men like Luther, Kant, Goethe, Beethoven, to mention
only a few. I have always interpreted nationalism as the desire of
a nation to be an example to other nations, and to maintain a
leading position in the field of spiritual and cultural achievement
through high moral standards and intellectual attainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If it please the Tribunal, it seems to
me that we are getting very far from the relevant charges in this
case, and particularly if they are going to be preceded by a statement
of the Prosecution’s position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no charge against Dr. Schacht because he opposed the
Treaty of Versailles; we concede it was the right of any German
citizen to do that by any means short of war. Nor do we object
to his being a patriotic German by any means short of war. The
only purpose has been to find out what his attitude in those matters
was in connection with the charge that he prepared and precipitated
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To deal with philosophical matters separately from the war
charge seems to me entirely irrelevant, and I assure the Tribunal
we have no purpose in charging that it is a crime to oppose the
Treaty of Versailles. Many Americans did that. It is no crime to
be a German patriot. The crime is the one defined in the Indictment,
and it seems to me we are a long way off from that here,
and wasting time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What do you say to that, Dr. Dix?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I was eager and glad to hear what Justice Jackson
just said, but I must quote from Wallenstein, “Before dinner we
heard another version.” There was no doubt—and once, because I
thought I had misunderstood, I even asked again—that the criminal
character of the Party program, the criminal character of the contents
of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>—reproachable in itself and, to say the least,
indicative of crimes committed later—the willful opposition to the
Treaty of Versailles—and further the accusation of having been
an expansionist and nationalist, all these things have repeatedly
in the course of the proceedings here been held against Dr. Schacht
in order to strengthen the foundation of the charges made against
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Mr. Justice Jackson now with gratifying frankness states, “We
do not at all blame Schacht for opposing the Treaty of Versailles;
we do not assert that he was more than a patriot, that is to say, a
nationalist in the sense described before, and we do not maintain
either that these our statements are circumstantial evidence for his
later co-operation, his financial co-operation, in the rearmament
program, which in turn is proof indicative of his intent to assist in
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
waging a war of aggression”—if that is now stated unequivocally
by the Prosecution, then we can dispense with a great many questions
which I intended to put in the course of my examination of
the witness; I would then gladly leave the whole subject of Schacht’s
expansionism and nationalism. We have not yet mentioned expansionism;
Mr. Justice Jackson has not mentioned it either. I do not
believe, however, that the Prosecution will withdraw the accusation
of expansionism, that is the expansion of German living
space in Europe. I am not sure of this but we shall certainly hear
about it. As I said, if these accusations which have been made are
withdrawn, then I can dispense with these questions and my client
need not answer them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Of course, I made no such statement
as Dr. Dix has assumed. My statement was clearly made in the
opening and clearly is now, that he had a perfect right to be against
the Treaty of Versailles and to be a German nationalist and to
follow those aims by all means short of war. I do not want to have
put in my mouth the very extensive statements made by Dr. Dix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My statement was made clear in the opening, and these matters
as to the Versailles Treaty and nationalism and Lebensraum, as
political and philosophical matters, are not for the Court to determine.
We are not going to ask you to say whether the Treaty of
Versailles was a just document or not. It was a document. They
had a right to do what they could to get away from it by all means
short of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The charge against Dr. Schacht is that he prepared, knowingly,
to accomplish those things by means of aggressive warfare. That is
the nub of the case against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then on this point there is...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, I think the case for the Prosecution
has been clear from the outset, that all these matters are only
relied upon when they were entered into with the intention of
making war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very true. I need not put these questions if the Prosecution
no longer uses these accusations as circumstantial evidence
for his intent to wage a war of aggression, but Mr. Justice Jackson
has not yet made a statement to that effect. But there seems to be
no doubt—and I do not believe that I misunderstood the Prosecution—that
in order to prove Dr. Schacht’s intention to wage a
war of aggression, the Prosecution did refer to Schacht’s opposition
to the Treaty of Versailles, to his nationalism and expansionism
that is, extension of Lebensraum. We do not want to make academic
or theoretical statements about the ideas of Lebensraum
and nationalism, but as long as these ideas, which the Prosecution
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
concedes he is justified in holding, as long as these characteristics
are considered to be in part proof of his intent, my client must
have the opportunity of telling the Tribunal just what he meant
by Lebensraum if he ever spoke of it, which I do not yet know.
But I think, nevertheless, that there is still a matter not quite
clear between Mr. Justice Jackson and me, and that I do not quite
agree either with what was said by Your Lordship...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What you were asking him about was his
views on nationalism. That is what you were asking him about,
his views upon nationalism, and that seems to be a waste of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I put to him that he was accused of being a nationalist
and an expansionist, and that the Prosecution therefrom drew the
conclusion that he planned an aggressive war by financing armament;
now he has to show, of course, that...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What Mr. Justice Jackson has pointed out
is that the Prosecution have never said that he simply held the
views of a nationalist and of an expansionist, but that he held
those views and intended to go to war in order to enforce them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, Your Lordship, but it is held that these opinions
were proof—one proof among others—that he had the intention of
waging aggressive war; that they therefore constitute what we
jurists should call circumstantial evidence for his intent, to wage
war, and as long as this argument—it is no longer a charge maintained
by Justice Jackson but it is an argument of the Prosecution...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is no issue about it. He agrees that
he did hold these views. Therefore it is quite unnecessary to go
into the fact. The Prosecution say he held the views; he agrees
that he held the views. The only question is whether he held them
with the innocent intention of achieving them by peaceful methods,
or whether he had the alleged criminal intention of achieving
them by war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I only wish to say one more thing to that. Expansionism
has not yet been discussed. Should Dr. Schacht have had
expansionist tendencies, then Mr. Justice Jackson certainly would
not say that he has no objection. Therefore...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, I think that you may ask him questions
about the expansionists, his ideas of what expansionists were,
what he meant by expansion, but for the rest it seems to me you
are simply proving exactly the same as the Prosecution have proved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I fully agree. Dr. Schacht, were you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I believe, Dr. Schacht, that both of us will have to
speak a little more slowly and pause between question and answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, please reply to the accusation by the Prosecution that
you were an expansionist. Please define your position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Never in my life have I demanded even a foot of
space that did not belong to Germany, nor would I ever entertain
such an idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am of the opinion that neither is it national to try to dominate
and govern foreign peoples, nor is appropriation of foreign territory
a politically just action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are two questions with which we are much concerned at
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might perhaps add, in order to clarify my position, just what
I understand by nationalism, and just why I was against each and
every form of expansionism. Just one sentence will suffice, a
sentence from a speech which I made in August of 1935. On that
occasion I said, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We want to express the belief that self-respect requires
respect for others, and the upholding of our national individuality
must not mean disparagement of the individuality
of others; by respecting the acts of others we respect our
own action; and a battle of economic competition can be
won in the end only through example and achievement and
not through methods of violence or craft.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: According to the opinion of the Prosecution, in the
year 1936 you made a public threat of war, on which occasion you
are alleged to have said that the spirit of Versailles was instrumental
in keeping alive war mania. I am referring to Document
EC-415, a document to which the Prosecution has referred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I never understood, in the course of this proceeding,
how there could be a threat of war in this quotation. The quotation
concludes with the words—and I must quote in English because
I just have the English words before me:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The spirit of Versailles is perpetuated in the fury of war,
and there will not be a true peace, progress, or reconstruction
until the world desists from this spirit. The German
people will not tire of pronouncing this warning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The conclusion says that the German people will not tire of
pronouncing this warning. It seems to be a matter of course that
hereby expression is given to the fact that I am warning others
from persisting in war mania. I am not warning ourselves, but the
entire world, to avoid perpetuating the spirit of Versailles.
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution further accuses you in this connection
that you publicly approved the idea of Lebensraum, for the German
people. In this special connection reference was made to the speech
you made at Frankfurt on 9 December 1936, in which you said:
“Germany has too limited Lebensraum for her population.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: This speech of 9 December 1936 was a speech which
was solely concerned with a restoration of the colonial rights of
Germany. I have never demanded any Lebensraum for Germany
other than colonial space. And in this instance, again, I am surprised
that just the American Prosecutor should accuse me on
my efforts in this direction, because in the Fourteen Points of
Wilson, which regrettably were not adhered to later on, the colonial
interests of the Germans are taken into consideration. In consequence,
I said, again and again: “If you want peace in Europe, give
Germany an economic outlet into which Germany can develop and
from which she can satisfy her needs. Otherwise Germany will
be a center of unrest and a problem for Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to quote one sentence only from the speech I made:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Peace in Europe, together with the peace of the entire
world, is dependent upon whether or not the densely populated
areas of Central Europe will have the means of existence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I emphasized this viewpoint again and again, but at no time
did I connect these views with the idea of an armed conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to quote another sentence from this same speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I did not mention this consideration as to the parts of
Germany which were separated from her”—and I am
speaking of the losses suffered by Germany—“in order that
we might draw the conclusion of warlike intentions; my
entire position and my work are marshaled to the objective
of bringing about peace in Europe through peaceful and
sensible considerations and measures.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you please give me the PS numbers
and the exhibit numbers of those two speeches?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I cannot at this moment, Your Lordship, I am sorry,
but I will try to get them and submit them in writing. The last
is the speech at Frankfurt, and the others...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is quite all right. You will let us know
in writing, will you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Perhaps if it is permitted I might refer to two
other sentences from my article which was published in <span class='it'>Foreign
Affairs</span>, the well-known American magazine, in the year 1937. I
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>
have the German translation before me, which says, in the introduction,
and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I am making these introductory remarks in order to clarify
the situation. The colonial problem today, as in the past, is
for Germany not a question of imperialism or militarism,
but still surely and simply a question of economic existence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps I might refer to the point that very influential Americans
were in constant accord with this view. I have a statement
made by the collaborator of President Wilson, Colonel House, who
made the well-known distinction between the “haves” and “have
nots,” and who was especially influential in advocating consideration
for German colonial interests. Perhaps I can dispense with
the quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In this connection I should like to point to the document
submitted by the Prosecution, Document L-111, Exhibit
USA-630. This document is concerned with the conversation which
you had with the American Ambassador Davies, and in which you
are accused of having indirectly threatened a breach of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have already set forth just now that I constantly
said that Europe cannot have peaceful development if there are no
means of livelihood for the completely overpopulated Central
Europe, and I believe conditions at present show how absolutely
right I was—just what an impossibility it is to feed these masses
of people within Europe. And beyond that I had a keen interest
in diverting Hitler’s quite misguided ideas from Eastern Europe
and therefore was constantly at pains to direct his attention to the
colonial problem so that I could turn his thought from the mad
ideas of expansionism in the East. I recall that in 1932, shortly
before he assumed office, I had a conversation with him in which
for the first time I approached him on these facts and particularly
told him what utter nonsense it would be to think of an expansion
in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, constantly, in the subsequent years, again and again, I
spoke about the colonial problem, until at the last in the summer
of 1936 I had the possibility of pursuing my ideas and Hitler gave
me the mission, which I had suggested to him, of going to Paris
to discuss with the French Government the possibility of a satisfactory
solution of the question of colonies for Germany. This
actually happened in the summer of 1936. And for the satisfaction
of myself and all other friends of peace, I might say that the
Government of Léon Blum, which was in office at the time, showed
gratifying appreciation of this solution for Europe’s food and economic
problems, and for their part stated that they were ready
to deal with the colonial problem with the aim of perhaps returning
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>
one or two colonies to Germany. Léon Blum then undertook, in
agreement with me, to inform the British Government about these
conversations in order to secure their consent or to bring up a
discussion of this problem within the British Government. That
actually did take place, but the British Government hesitated for
months before they finally could decide on any position in this
matter and so the discussion dragged on up to the initial months
of the Spanish civil war and was eclipsed and supplanted by the
problems of the Spanish civil war, so that a continuation of the
discussion on this colonial problem never came about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time, in January of 1937, when the American Ambassador
to Moscow, Ambassador Joseph Davies, visited me at Berlin,
I was rather irritated by the slowness with which the British Government
was meeting these suggestions, and consequently I came
forth with a request for understanding and support and told Ambassador
Davies about this whole matter. I tried constantly and
repeatedly to gain the understanding support of representatives of
the American Government. I tried again and again to advise these
gentlemen about domestic conditions and developments within Germany,
to tell them as much as was possible and compatible with
German interests and to keep them informed. That applies to
Ambassador Davies, Ambassador Dodd, Ambassador Bullitt when
he was in Berlin, and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This conversation with Ambassador Davies is referred to in the
document which the Prosecution has submitted, Document L-111,
and which is taken from the book which Ambassador Davies wrote
about his mission in Moscow, and we will perhaps come back to this
book later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the gist of my conversation with Davies I would like to quote
just one sentence again, which I must again quote in English, since
I have only the English book at my disposal.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Schacht earnestly urged that some such feasible plan could
be developed if discussions could be opened; and that, if
successful, would relieve the European war menace, relieve
peoples of enormous expenditures for armaments, restore free
flow of international commerce, give outlet to thrift and
natural abilities of his countrymen and change their present
desperation into future hope.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In this connection the affidavit of Fuller plays an
important part, that is Exhibit USA-629, and Document EC-450.
According to this affidavit, you allegedly declared to Fuller that if
Germany could not get colonies through negotiations she would
take them. Please define your position as to this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In a German drama an intriguer is being instructed
by a tyrant to bring a man of honor to ruin, and he says in reply,
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>
“Just give me one word said by this man, and I will hang him
thereby.” I believe, My Lord Justices, that in this courtroom there
is not a single person who at one time or another in his life has not
said a rather unfortunate word. And how much easier is it when he
is speaking in a foreign language of which he is not completely
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fuller is known to me as a respectable business man, and
this discussion which he has here reproduced is indubitably done
according to the best of his knowledge. He himself rightly says that
even had he tried to put down the exact words he could not
guarantee that each and every word has been said. But if I did say
these words, then it seems only that I said we Germans must have
colonies and we shall have them. Whether I said, “We shall take
them,” or “We shall get them,” that, of course, it is impossible for
me to say with certainty today after a period of 10 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The representative of the Prosecution also thought the expression,
“We will take them,” a little colorless in effect and therefore
I believe he just added a trifle, for he said twice in his presentation
of the charges that I had said, “We will take these colonies by
force,” and on a second occasion he even said, “We will take these
colonies by force of arms.” But “force” or “force of arms” are not
mentioned in the whole of Fuller’s affidavit. And if I had used that
word or even used it only by implication, Mr. Fuller would have
had to say with reason: “So you want to take colonies by force;
how do you expect to do that?” It would have been utter nonsense
to assert that Germany would ever have been able to take overseas
colonies by force. She lacked—and always will lack—domination of
the seas, which is necessary for this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fuller did not take exception to my manner of expression and
in his conversation he immediately continued—and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“You mentioned a little while ago that necessary raw
materials could not be obtained, owing to German lack of
foreign exchange. Would stabilization help you?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, rather than to become excited about the fact that I
wanted to take colonies by force—something which I never said
and which is contrary to my views, as I have already stated—he
immediately goes on to foreign exchange and to stabilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The prosecutor asserts further that you were interested
in the conquest of neighboring territory in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: This matter is not quite so harmless as the previous
mistake of the Prosecution. In a previous interrogation, I was
accused as follows, and the prosecutor, in presenting his charges
here, referred to the fact—I quote the prosecutor:
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On 16 April, on the occasion of the Paris conference on
reparation payments, Schacht said, ‘Germany in general can
pay only if the Corridor and Upper Silesia are returned to
Germany.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the interrogation of 24 August 1945. According to the
verbatim record of the interrogation, I answered:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It may be that I said such a thing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, as far as the wording of a statement, which I had
made 10 to 15 years before, I did not recall it. But I did remember
that in connection with the Corridor and Upper Silesia I had made
a remark, and since I had to assume that if the Prosecution submitted
this record to me it would be an accurate stenographic
record, for that reason I did not dispute this remark which I had
allegedly made and said that it might be that I said something to
that effect. The Prosecution takes a “maybe” and out of that reconstructed
the following sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This quotation was read to Schacht, and he said it was
correct.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This assertion by the Prosecution is therefore wrong. I said, “It
may be that I said something to that effect,” but I did not say that
this statement that was submitted to me was correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, fortunately, in my imprisonment here, I succeeded in getting
hold of my book, a book which I wrote about the termination of
reparation payments, which was published in 1931 and in which I
luckily put down the text of my statement about the matter we are
dealing with now. I have the exact text, and I would like to say
that this book has been submitted in evidence, and from this text
appears what I said verbatim:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Regarding the problem of German food and food supplies,
it is especially important that import of foodstuffs has been
decreased”—I beg your pardon—“that import will be decreased.”—I
am sorry again. I cannot read this—“that the
import of foodstuffs will be decreased and partially made up
through home production. Therefore, we cannot let the fact
be overlooked that important agricultural surplus territories
in the eastern part of Germany have been lost by cession and
that a large territory which was almost exclusively agrarian
has been separated from the Reich. Therefore the economic
welfare of this territory, East Prussia, is decreasing steadily
and the Reich Government must support and subsidize it.
Constantly, therefore, suitable measures should be taken to
eliminate these injurious conditions, which are hindering considerably
Germany’s ability to pay.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, this is from our document book, Document
Schacht-16, German Page 38, English Page 44.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: This quotation absolutely does not agree with the
statement submitted to me in the interrogation, and in no way can
we draw the conclusion in consequence that I was in favor of a
return of these areas. What I demanded was that the separation of
these areas be taken into consideration when Germany’s ability to
pay and the payments were determined. When the prosecutor in
his speech added: “I would like to point out that this is the same
area over which the war started in September 1939,” I believe it is
an insinuation which characterizes the prosecutor, rather than me,
against whom it was intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: As part of the circumstantial evidence, that is, the
indirect evidence for the will to aggression, with which you are
charged, the Prosecution includes your wish—your alleged wish—for
the Anschluss of Austria. Will you please take your position as
to this accusation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: From 1919 I considered the Anschluss of Austria
inevitable and, in the national sense, that is, spiritually and culturally,
it was welcome. But that economically the Anschluss of
Austria would not be for Germany so much an aggrandizement as a
liability. I always knew. But the wish of the Austrian people to
belong, to be incorporated into Germany—I took that wish as my
own and said that if here there are six and a half million people
who spontaneously in 1919 and later in innumerable demonstrations
expressed their wish of being incorporated into the brotherhood of
Greater Germany, that was an event to which no German could be
opposed, but in the interest of Austria must hail with gladness. In
that sense I always favored and respected the wish of Austria to
belong to the Reich and wanted it carried through as soon as
external political conditions permitted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: My attention has just been called to the fact that you
are still speaking too fast and that the interpretation is lagging
behind a little bit. Will you please speak a little more slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was your opinion as to the incorporation of the Sudetenland
into Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Concerning the incorporation of the Sudetenland,
I never thought of any such thing. Of course, Czechoslovakia was a
European problem, and it was regrettable that in that state, which
had five and a half million Czechs, two and a half million Slovaks
and about three and a half million Germans, the German element
had no means of expression. But just because the Czechoslovakian
problem was not a purely German-Czech but also a Slovak-Czech
problem, I sought a solution of this problem in such a way and
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>
wished it to be in such a way that Czechoslovakia should constitute
a federated state, similar perhaps to Switzerland, divided into three
different, culturally separate, but politically unified areas, which
would be a guarantee for the unity of a German-Czech-Slovak state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What was your opinion and attitude to the problem of
war; by that I mean, as far as philosophical, ideological, and practical
considerations are concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I always considered war as one of the most devastating
things to which mankind is exposed and on basic principles
throughout my entire life I was a pacifist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Schacht, during your meditative and thoughtful
life you have certainly considered the fundamental and profound
differences between legitimate and ethically based soldiership and
militarism in its various degenerate forms. What did you mean by
the latter and what was your attitude toward it, that is, militarism?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Of course I saw the necessity of a country’s defense
in case of war or threats, and I stood for that theory. In that sense
I was always in favor of a Wehrmacht, but the profession of a
soldier I consider to be full of deprivations and characterized by
willingness and readiness to sacrifice, not because perhaps during a
war the soldier has to give up his life—that is the duty of every
citizen of military age—but because his whole aim and aspiration
must be directed to the end that never must the craft which he has
learned be exercised. A soldier, a career officer, who is not intrinsically
a pacifist, has really in my opinion missed his calling.
Consequently, I was always an opponent of every military digression
and excess. I was always against militarism, but I consider that
soldiership conscious of its responsibility is the highest calling
which a citizen can pursue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, George Messersmith, as you know, the Consul
General of the United States at Berlin at one time, says in one of
his various affidavits produced by the Prosecution that you had told
him, and repeatedly told him, about Nazi intents of aggression. Will
you please state your position in that regard?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: First of all, I would like to remark that of course I
never made a statement of that sort, neither to Mr. George Messersmith
nor to anyone else. As far as these three affidavits of Mr.
Messersmith, which were submitted by the Prosecution, are concerned,
I would like to make a further statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Messersmith asserts that he had frequent contact and
numerous private conversations with me, and I would like to state
here now that, according to my exact memory, I saw Mr. George
Messersmith perhaps two or three times in my entire life. Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
George Messersmith represents himself as having had numerous
contacts and many private conversations with me, and he asserts
further that his official capacity brought him in contact with me as
President of the Reichsbank and as Minister of Economics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not recall once having received Mr. Messersmith in my
office. Mr. George Messersmith takes these two or three discussions
and proceeds to characterize me. He calls me cynical, ambitious,
egotistic, vain, two-faced. I am, unfortunately, not in a position to
give an equally comprehensive picture of the character of Mr. Messersmith.
But I must definitely dispute his trustworthiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as a first reason for this I should like to quote a general
remark by Mr. Messersmith. In his affidavit of 30 August 1945,
Document 2385-PS, Mr. George Messersmith says, and I quote:
“When the Nazi Party took over Germany, it represented only a
small part of the German population.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Contrary to that, I say that before the Nazi Party took over
Germany it occupied about forty percent of all Reichstag seats. That
percentage Mr. Messersmith calls a small part of the German
population. If diplomatic reports are everywhere as reliable as in
this instance, it is small wonder that nations do not understand each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would still like to correct a specific remark by Mr. Messersmith.
Mr. Messersmith asserts, as I have quoted just a minute ago,
that his duty brought him in contact with me as Minister of
Economics. In his affidavit of 28 August, 1760-PS, Mr. Messersmith
says, and I quote: “During the wave of terrorist activity in May
and June of 1934, I had already assumed my duties as American
Chargé d’Affaires in Vienna.” In August of 1934 I became Minister
of Economics, whereas, on the other hand, Mr. Messersmith, already
in May of 1934, assumed his official duties in Vienna; but this does
not prevent Mr. Messersmith from asserting that his official duties
brought him in frequent contact with me as Minister of Economics.
I believe this will suffice to gauge the capacity of Mr. Messersmith’s
memory correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In a similar connection, the Prosecution repeatedly
referred to the diary of the former ambassador in Berlin, Mr. Dodd,
which was published on the basis of his private notes by his children
after his death. This document has the Document Number EC-461.
The Prosecution quotes from this diary repeatedly to prove that
Mr. Dodd, too, considered you a warmonger. I know, of course, that
you were a friend of Mr. Dodd’s, a fact which is shown in his diary.
Can you tell me how the two facts can be reconciled?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: First of all, I might say that Ambassador Dodd was
one of the most undefiled personalities I have met, an upright
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>
character, a man of unflinching fidelity to his convictions. He was
a professor of history, undoubtedly a good historian. He had studied
at German universities. I believe that he would turn in his grave
if he could know that the notes which he put down casually in his
diary were put together by his two children without commentary
and printed without investigation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dodd, I am sorry to say, had one characteristic which made
dealing with him a little difficult. I think the reason for this lay in
his steadfastness of conviction, which from the first often made him
appear averse to outside influence. He found it rather hard to make
himself understood easily and fluently, and he was even less in a
position to view opinions of others in the right light. Many things
that were told him he misunderstood and saw in a wrong light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 176 in his diary, in the lower part, there is one sentence
I would like to quote to illustrate the point I am trying to make.
Here he says: “I talked fifteen minutes with Phipps”—the British
Ambassador at that time—“about the accumulated evidence of
Germany’s intense war activities.” This statement dates from the
autumn of 1934 and I believe no one is able to say that in the
autumn of 1934 there was any talk of a war activity on the part of
Germany. Mr. Dodd uses the expression “war” undoubtedly in the
place of “armament”; he says “Krieg” instead of “Aufrüstung.” In
that sense, I believe he misunderstood the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as further evidence for the difficulty which one had in
making the Ambassador understand, I might say that the Foreign
Office asked him once to bring a secretary who would take notes
of discussions with representatives of the Foreign Office, so that
misunderstandings could be avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe, therefore, that all these statements by Mr. Dodd are
apt to be misunderstood. As for myself I can only say what I have
already said about Mr. Messersmith, that of course I never talked
about war intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, in this diary it says that he was favorably
disposed towards you. Do you have any proof for this friendly
attitude to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I perhaps refer to the correspondence with
Henderson...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, we can deal with that later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Then I shall just confine myself to your question.
Dodd was entirely friendly to me, and I respected him deeply.
I saw a sign of his friendship in that shortly before his departure
from Berlin in December of 1937 he visited me at my home, and
this incident is also dealt with in his diary, and I would like to
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
quote just one sentence: “I went to Dr. Schacht’s house in Dahlem.
I wished especially to see Schacht, whose life is said to be in danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, Mr. Dodd had heard of an imminent attack on
my life on the part of National Socialists, and considered it important
enough and a reason for coming to my home personally in
order to warn me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second piece of evidence of his friendship towards me can be
seen from the final visit he paid me just a few days before returning
to America. At that time he again called on me and told me urgently
that I should go to America with him, or as soon after him as
possible, that I should change my residence to America, and that I
would find a pleasant welcome there. I believe he would never
have said that to me had he not felt a certain degree of friendship
for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: These are express services of friendship, and it can
hardly be assumed that the deceased Ambassador would have done
you these good services if he had considered you a warmonger and
friend of the Nazis, and especially—and I would like to say this to
the High Tribunal—if one remembers that Mr. Dodd was one of the
few accredited diplomats in Berlin who very obviously had no
sympathy of any sort for the regime in power, in fact he was
wholly and fully opposed to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I intentionally say “the few diplomats” and, Dr. Schacht, I would
like you to define your opinion on what I am saying. You will
remember that those diplomats who kept aloof from Hitler’s regime
politically and socially, such as the Dutch Minister, the magnificent
grand seigneur Limburg-Stirum, or the Minister from Finland, the
true-hearted and great Social Democrat, Wuolijoki, that most of
these diplomats were recalled by their Governments. How is it that
an opponent of the Nazis like Dodd did such open services of
friendship to someone whom he considered a friend of the Nazis?
Do you agree with my opinion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I am entirely of the same opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I certainly object to going into this
kind of sermonizing back and forth between the box and the bar.
It seems to me that the witness has been allowed to say everything
that Mr. Dodd has ever written and to put in his mind what he
thinks Dodd meant. He has allowed him to go to great lengths
characterizing all American representatives, but it seems to me that
this is utterly off the track and improper for this witness to give
a characterization of him in comparison with other ambassadors and
other diplomatic representatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no request here for information about facts. I reiterate,
we are not accusing Dr. Schacht here because of his opinions. We
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>
are accusing him because of very specific facts which there seems
great reluctance to get to and deal with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you should go on, Dr. Dix, and pass
from this part of it, pass on from these documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Perhaps I might mention very briefly that it is entirely
far from me or from Dr. Schacht to feel impelled to express here
our opinions on political or diplomatic personalities, but, on the
other hand, if the Prosecution produces affidavits or diaries of these
diplomats and uses these documents as pieces of evidence against
the defendant in this proceeding, the defendant...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that if you would put
questions and put them shortly, it would be much better, and we
should get on much faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes. In general I have put brief questions, Your Lordship.
I only said this now, because I would like to follow the procedure
approved, I believe, by the High Tribunal, of dealing with
part of the evidence at this stage; and so I would like to bring up
the reliability of Dodd’s Diary. That is Document Schacht-43 in my
document book; German text, Page 194; English text, Page 202.
Here we are concerned with the correspondence between the
publisher of Dodd’s diary and Sir Nevile Henderson, which deals
with several misstatements in the diary. I will dispense with the
rather long letter by Sir Nevile Henderson—there are five folio
pages—and will cite just a few sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 196 of the German text, Sir Nevile Henderson writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Take, for instance, the first statement attributed to me about
Neurath. It is entirely impossible, that I, in front of Hitler...”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and so on and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then on the same page, in the middle of the page, next paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“And it is the same with the general discussion. It is quite
inconceivable that I should have spoken, as there recorded,
about Bismarck and the annexation of Czechoslovakia and
other countries.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And on the same page, a little further down, next to the last
paragraph, it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Nor could I possibly have said that ‘Germany must dominate
the Danube-Balkan zone.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And on the next page, second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The remark attributed to me that England and Germany
‘must control the world’ is pure balderdash and hardly fits in
with the preceding sentence about the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, there are other similar passages on this and the following
page, but I do not believe it necessary for me to quote them. I
request the High Tribunal to take official notice of this document
in its entirety, and I would like to submit it as such.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Dr. Schacht, a little while ago you
mentioned a warning on the part of Ambassador Dodd with regard
to a danger which was threatening you. Was it an attack on your
life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: At that time—and I only heard about this in
January after Mr. Dodd told me—I was informed that the SS was
planning an attack on my person. The intent was, as the technical
expression then had it, “to remove” me. Something like that must
have been in the air; otherwise, a foreign ambassador and the
circles close to me would not have known about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Just a little while ago you set forth how your policy
rejected the use of arms in bringing about equality of German
rights and means of livelihood. Did you try to do anything in a
practical way to further your policy of peaceful agreement with
foreign countries, for example, when you were President of the
bank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: My entire work as President of the Reichsbank was
primarily based on the principle of working with the banks in
foreign countries as harmoniously as possible, of pursuing a policy
of mutual assistance and support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, I tried to enter into personal, friendly relations with
the directors of all these banks in the hope of meeting understanding
for German problems, and thus of contributing to a solution by
way of co-operation and mutual solution of these difficult problems
which had arisen in Central Europe. The word “co-operation” (Zusammenarbeit)
was the leitmotif of our circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: To turn from the directors of the banks, what about
your foreign creditors?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As I already said a little while ago, from the start
I was in disfavor with all the money makers, those people who had
profited from German loans in foreign countries for I was against
Germany’s being involved in debts abroad, and I took my stand
very firmly on this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then later, after the misfortune which I had always predicted
actually did come to pass, after the financial crash in the year 1931,
these self-same financiers and money men blamed me for the fact
that the interest on their money was no longer being transferred to
them. Therefore in those circles I did not gain any friends, but
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>
among serious bankers and large banking institutions which were
interested in constant and regulated business with Germany, I
believe I made no enemies, because all measures which I later had
to take in order to protect the German currency and to maintain
Germany’s foreign trade, all these measures I always discussed
jointly with the representatives of foreign creditors. Approximately
every six months we met, and I always gave them a detailed
account of German conditions. They were permitted to look into
the books of the Reichsbank. They could examine and interrogate
the officials of the Reichsbank and they always confirmed that I
told them everything in the most frank and open manner. So that
I may say that I worked in a fair and friendly way also with
these men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And how did your policy of peaceful agreement affect
foreign trade, export, credit, and so forth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I believe that after the happenings that have now
taken place it is today even clearer than before that Germany
cannot and could not live without foreign trade, and that the maintenance
of export trade must be the basis for the future existence
of the German nation. Consequently, I did everything in order to
maintain German foreign trade. I can cite a few specific examples
to supplement the general principles. I tried, for example, to do
business with China in order that we might export to China. I was
ready to give China credit and did. I hailed the fact that the Soviet
Union kept up an extensive flow of trade with us, and I always
advocated expanding and stabilizing this foreign trade in the case
of Russia as well as China. About the ability and readiness to pay
and the promptness of payment of the opposite parties I never had
any doubts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He is going into unnecessary detail in support
of the allegation that he tried to maintain export trade. We do not
surely need details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, this exposition
is of great significance and relevance. It shows Schacht contrary
and in opposition to the policy carried out by Hitler. Hitler was
hostile to the Soviet Union and this hostility is counterbalanced by
open friendliness on the part of and in the person of the Minister of
Economics. If I want to prove that Schacht was pioneer of a policy
of understanding between nations, even in phases where Hitler
carried on a peaceful battle, so to speak, with another country,
such as the war of propaganda against the Soviet Union, then, in
my opinion, this point is very important for Schacht’s fundamental
attitude—on one side war and on the other understanding. This is
of absolute relevance.
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The defendant has made the allegation. It is
for the Prosecution to dispute it in cross-examination and if they do,
then the details might become material in re-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I believe the question has been answered, and now
I shall turn to an entirely new phase of questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since it is typical of his desire for understanding and his direct
basic opposition to the policy of Hitler, I would like to refer to
Document Number Schacht-34, which is an affidavit, of Schniewind,
the banker and Swedish Consul General at Munich. This is Exhibit 34,
Page 114, of the English translation, and I would like to quote
a short paragraph on Page 112 of the German text, which confirms
Dr. Schacht’s remarks. Schniewind, who was a high official in the
Ministry of Economics, says here:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“My department dealt with the Reich guarantees for deliveries
to Russia, and thus I was in position to know that
Schacht considered Hitler wrong in fighting Russia. Through
much effort, he obtained Hitler’s permission to send extensive
supplies, especially machines to Russia. Frequently I gained
the impression that Herr Schacht favored these deliveries
because, while instrumental in giving employment, they did
not benefit rearmament. Herr Schacht on several public
occasions pointed out with satisfaction that trade shipments
to Russia were proceeding promptly and smoothly.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are just a few more minutes before the customary recess,
Your Honor, and before we take our recess, I ask that I be permitted
to reply shortly to Your Lordship’s remarks of a few minutes ago.
The defendant must conduct what is, to a certain degree, a very
difficult defense. The Prosecution very simply argued: “You helped
to finance rearmament and this rearmament in the final analysis
ended in war and not only a war but a war of aggression; therefore,
you as a defendant are either a conspirator or an accomplice, and
that is a war crime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as this argument is concerned, it must in my opinion be
open to the defendant, first—and we shall deal with that later—to
point out that rearmament as such by no means constitutes a desire
for aggressive war; and secondly, to show that his acts actually
indicate the exact opposite, namely, his desire for concord and
peace; and for these fundamental reasons, I do beg the Tribunal not
to cut me short in this evidence but rather to give me the time to
carry it through in detail. This explains my desire to set forth
Schacht’s policy toward the Soviet Union, a policy in which he was
in direct opposition to Hitler, to bring it forth in its entirety, and
also my wish to show that he worked for agreement on all levels—with
directors of banks and credit furnishers—that is, he advocated
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>
a policy of give and take rather than one of unilateral terrorizing
and strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentlemen of the Bench, it is chiefly on a psychological plane on
which I have to conduct the defense; that is a very sensitive and
delicate field, and I again ask that my task may not be made more
difficult. Then, when the witnesses are called, I for my part will
most likely dispense with every witness except one, and I beg that
you show me some consideration. Does Your Lordship consider it
time for a recess?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly, Dr. Dix. I thought that the
Tribunal has shown you every consideration, and we will now certainly
have a recess.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Schacht, what was your attitude toward the
Leadership Principle? Did you not realize the danger of giving a
blank check, the danger of losing your own capacity of responsibility?
You have heard that Sir David considers the Leadership
Principle in itself to be criminal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As to whether the Leadership Principle is criminal
or not, opinions throughout history have been much divided. If we
look back through Roman history we see that from time to time in
dire periods of distress a leader was selected to whom everyone
else was subordinate. And if I read <span class='it'>Failure of a Mission</span> by Henderson
there, too, I find sentences in which he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“People in England sometimes forget and fail to realize that
even dictators can be, up to a point, necessary for a period
and even extremely beneficial for a nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another passage from the same book says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Dictatorships are not always evil.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, it depends on just what is attributed to a Führer,
how much confidence one has in a Führer, and for how long a time.
Of course, it is a sheer impossibility for someone to assume the
leadership of a country without giving the nation from time to
time an opportunity of saying whether it still wants to keep him
as Führer or not. The election of Hitler as Führer was in itself
no political mistake; in my opinion one could have introduced
quite a number of precautionary limitations with a view to averting
the danger you have mentioned. I regret to say that that was not
done, and that was a great mistake. But perhaps one was entitled
to rely on the fact that from time to time a referendum, a plebiscite,
a new expression of the will of the people would take place by
which the Führer could have been corrected, because a leader who
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>
cannot be corrected becomes a menace. I recognized that danger
very well, I was afraid of it, and I attempted to meet it. May I say
one more thing? Limitless Party propaganda attempted to introduce
the idea of a Führer as a lasting principle into politics. That of
course is utter nonsense, and I took the opportunity—I always took
such opportunity whenever it was possible—of expressing my dissenting
opinions publicly. I took the opportunity in an address to
the Academy of German Law, of which not only Nazis but lawyers
of all groups were members, and in that speech I lectured about
the Leadership Principle in economics. And I expressed myself
ironically and satirically, as unfortunately is my wont, and said
that it was not necessary to have a leader in every stocking factory,
that in fact, this principle was not a principle at all, but an exceptional
rule which had to be handled very carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I know that, because I was present on the occasion
of that address. What did you think about the ideology of the
master race (Herrenvolk)?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have always considered it a very unhappy precedent
to speak of a “chosen people,” or of “God’s own country,” or
of things like that. As a convinced adherent to the Christian faith
I believe in Christian charity, which bids me extend love to all men
without regard to race or faith. I would like to mention also that
the silly talk about the master race, which some Party leaders
made their own, was held up to constant ridicule by the German
public. That was not surprising, because most of the leaders of
the Hitler Party were not exactly ideal types of the Nordic race.
And in that connection, when these things were discussed among
the German population, little Goebbels was referred to as “Der
Schrumpfgermane”—the shrivelled Teuton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one thing—I have to say this to be just—did most of the
leaders of the Party have in common with the old Teutons—and
that was drinking; excessive drinking was a main part of the Nazi
ideology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What did you think of the so-called National Socialist
Weltanschauung?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Weltanschauung in my opinion is a summation of
all those moral principles which enable me to acquire a clear judgment
on all aspects of life. Therefore it is a matter of course that
a Weltanschauung cannot take root in the tangible world, but
must rise above it; it is something metaphysical, that is to say, it is
based on faith, on religion. A Weltanschauung which is not rooted
in religion is in my opinion no Weltanschauung at all. Consequently
I reject the National Socialist Weltanschauung which was not rooted
in religion.
<span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In the trial brief against you it is expressly stated
that there are no charges against you with regard to the Jewish
question. Nevertheless I am putting to you a few questions on this
topic, because the trial brief by its very words takes from you what
in the Jewish question it conceded you; that is to say, the trial
brief accuses you repeatedly of Nazi ideology, in which strict observance
of anti-Semitism is integral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I simply cannot be bound by silence
after this flagrant misstatement of our position made in conjunction
with this witness’ testimony. It is not true that we make no charges
against Dr. Schacht with reference to the Jews. What is true is that
we say that he was not in complete sympathy with that aspect of
the Nazi program which involved a wholesale extermination of the
Jews, and he was for that reason attacked from time to time. It
is further conceded that he gave aid and comfort to individual
Jews, but we do charge that he believed the Jews of Germany
should be stripped of their rights as citizens, and that he aided
and participated in their persecution. And I do not like to have
our position misstated and then be met with a claim of estoppel
by silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I have to thank you, Mr. Justice Jackson, for your
clarifying statement, and it is now all the more necessary that I
put in questions to Dr. Schacht, but at this moment I want to point
out...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Please put it then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, it is not only a question, but it is
a problem, and I should like to ask the Prosecution to clarify it now,
because it still needs clarification even after the statement of Mr.
Justice Jackson. If the Tribunal do not think that this is the
opportune time I can bring it up later. I believe, however, that it
would be right to bring it up how.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I see it, there is a contradiction in the Indictment, and I
would like it clarified, so that we shall not be at cross-purposes in
our final speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can put it quite briefly. It is the question of whether
Dr. Schacht is accused also of Crimes against Humanity, that is,
not only the crime of conspiracy concerning the war of aggression,
but also the typical crimes against humanity, for on this point the
individual passages, both of the Indictment and of the Prosecution
speech in which the charges were presented, are at variance. I
wanted to take the liberty of pointing out the contradictory passages
and to ask the Prosecution to be kind enough to state conclusively
at some future occasion whether Schacht is accused also
on Count Three and Four of the Indictment. In presenting the
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span>
charges the Prosecution stated, and that indicates that the Prosecution
will limit itself to Counts One and Two:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Our evidence against the Defendant Schacht is limited to
the planning and preparation of aggressive war and his
participation in the conspiracy for aggressive war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar statements are on Page 3 of the trial brief. Also, in
Appendix A of the Indictment the charges against Schacht are
limited to Counts One and Two. However, on Page 1 of the Indictment
we find the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...accuse as guilty...of Crimes against Peace, War Crimes,
and Crimes against Humanity, and of a Common Plan or
Conspiracy to commit those Crimes....”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then all the defendants are listed, including the Defendant
Hjalmar Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 17 of the German text of the Indictment we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On the basis of the facts previously stated, the defendants”—that
is, all the defendants—“are guilty.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is, all the defendants are guilty of Counts One, Two, Three,
Four. It also states, on Page 18 of the Indictment:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“All defendants committed, from 1 September 1939 to 8 May
1945, War Crimes in Germany and in countries and territories
occupied by German troops after 1 September 1939 and in
Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and on the high seas.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 46 it reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“During several years before the 8th of May 1945, all defendants
committed Crimes against Humanity in Germany”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>—and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, some parts of the oral presentation and of the Indictment
show that the Prosecution limits its charges against Schacht
to Counts One and Two, but other passages express beyond doubt
that he is also accused of Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it would be helpful—it need not be done immediately,
but I wanted as a precaution to express it now—if at the proper
time the Prosecution would state to what extent the charges apply
to Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Your Honor, it will take only one
moment to answer that, and I think the cross-examination—the
examination should not proceed under any misapprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all times, and in all documents that I am aware of, the Defendant
Schacht has been accused of being guilty of Count One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Count One, as the statement of the offense, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Common Plan or Conspiracy embraced the commission
of Crimes against Peace in that the defendants planned,
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>
prepared, and initiated wars of aggression... In the development
and course of the Common Plan it came to embrace
the commission of War Crimes, in that it contemplated, and
the defendants determined upon, and carried out ruthless
war...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And that included also Crimes against Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our contention is that, while the Defendant Schacht himself was
not in the field perpetrating these individual atrocities, he is
answerable for every offense committed by any of the defendants
or their co-conspirators up to the time that he openly broke with
this outfit with which he became associated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is our contention and Dr. Dix should conduct his examination
on the assumption that every charge is a charge against
Schacht up to the time that he openly, and on record so that somebody
knew it, became separated from the company with which he
chose to travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is probably my fault, but I still cannot see clearly.
First, I do not know what date the Prosecution means when it
admits that Schacht openly broke with the regime. I must, during
my examination...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you must make up your own mind
as to what time it was, the time at which he openly broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are you not able to hear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I have to make up my mind now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I think you had better go on with the
evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: All right. I can refer to the subject again later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Well then, please do not make any
statements of principle concerning the Jewish question, but tell the
Tribunal, and give a few examples, of what your attitude was on
the Jewish question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The Jewish question came up quite early, when,
in 1933, a New York banker, the late James Meier, announced his
intention to visit me. I went to Hitler at that time and told him,
“Mr. James Meier, one of the most respected New York bankers
and a great benefactor of his old home country, Germany, will
come to visit me, and I intend to give a dinner in his honor. I
assume that you have no objection.” He immediately said, in a
very definite and pronounced manner, “Herr Schacht, you can do
everything.” I assumed that he gave me absolute freedom to keep
in contact with my Jewish friends, which I did. The dinner actually
took place.
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I only mention this because it was the first time the Jewish
question was brought up between us. At every occasion I took a
definite position on the Jewish question—and wherever possible,
publicly—I have always looked for that opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will give only two examples of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a branch of the Reichsbank in Amswalde in the
Province of Brandenburg. The name of the manager of that branch
office was one day posted up in one of the public <span class='it'>Stürmer</span> boxes in
his town, and termed a traitor to the people because his wife had
bought 50 pfennings worth of ribbon or the like in a Jewish store.
I at once approached the competent official at Amswalde and demanded
the immediate removal of the placard and an immediate
correction to the effect that the man was no traitor to the people.
That was refused; whereupon, without asking anyone, I closed
the Reichsbank branch at Amswalde. It took a number of weeks
until, in the end, the Oberpräsident, who was of course also a Nazi
boss, came to me and asked me to reopen the branch office. I told
him, “As soon as they repudiate that affair publicly I shall reopen
the branch office at Amswalde.” It took only a few days before the
Oberpräsident and Gauleiter of Brandenburg, Grube, had the announcement
made public in the Amswalde newspaper, in large
print, and so I reopened the branch office in Amswalde. That is
one example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second example has been mentioned briefly; I just want to
sum it up once more because its effect was penetrating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the occasion of a Christmas celebration for the office messengers
of the Reichsbank I referred to the pogrom of 9 November
1938, and I told the boys, in the presence of many—parents, Party
leaders, and Party members—that I hoped they had nothing to do
with these things, which should make every decent German blush
with shame. But if they did they should leave the Reichsbank at
once, because in an institution such as the Reichsbank, which was
built up on good faith, there was no place for people who did not
respect the property and life of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I interrupt you, Dr. Schacht, and point out to
the Tribunal that in Document Number Schacht-34, which has been
submitted and is an affidavit of Dr. Schniewind, on Page 118 of the
German text and on Page 126 of the English text the same incident
which Dr. Schacht has just related is mentioned. May I quote quite
briefly:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is known that at the Christmas celebration of the Reichsbank
in December of 1938 he”—that is Schacht—“said the following
in his address to the young office boys:
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span></p>

<p>“ ‘A few weeks ago things occurred in our fatherland which
are a disgrace to civilization and which must turn every
decent German’s face red with shame. I only hope that none
of you office boys participated in them, because for such an
individual there is no place in the Reichsbank.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Excuse me. Please continue. You
wanted to add something?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: When in August of 1934 I took over the Reich
Ministry of Economics, of course I first put the question to Hitler:
“How are the Jews in our national economy to be treated?” Hitler
told me then, literally, “The Jews can be active in domestic economy
in the same way as before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the directive that Hitler had promised to me, and
during all the time when I was in charge of the Ministry of Economics
I acted accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, I have to add that every few weeks there was a
quarrel on some Jewish question with some Gauleiter or other
Party official. Also, I could not protect Jews against physical mistreatment
and the like, because that came under the competence of
the Public Prosecutor and not mine; but in the economic field I
helped all Jews who approached me to obtain their rights, and in
every individual case, I prevailed upon Hitler and succeeded against
the Gauleiters and Party officials, sometimes even threatening to
resign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that it is notable that the pogrom of November 1938
could only have taken place after I had resigned from my office.
Had I still been in office, then that pogrom doubtlessly would not
have occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The witness Gisevius has already testified that in the
course of developments from 1933 on, fundamental changes took
place in your judgment of Adolf Hitler. I ask you now, because
this is a very decisive question, to give the Tribunal a detailed
description of your real attitude and your judgment of Adolf Hitler
in the course of the years—as exhaustively, but also as briefly,
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In former statements which I have made here, I
have spoken of Hitler as a semi-educated man. I still maintain that.
He did not have sufficient school education, but he read an enormous
amount later, and acquired a wide knowledge. He juggled with that
knowledge in a masterly manner in all debates, discussions, and
speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt he was a man of genius in certain respects. He had
sudden ideas of which nobody else had thought and which were
at times useful in solving great difficulties, sometimes with
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>
astounding simplicity, sometimes, however, with equally astounding
brutality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a mass psychologist of really diabolical genius. While
I myself and several others—for instance, General Von Witzleben
told me so once—while we were never captivated in personal conversations,
still he had a very peculiar influence on other people,
and particularly he was able—in spite of his screeching and occasionally
breaking voice—to stir up the utmost overwhelming
enthusiasm of large masses in a filled auditorium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that originally he was not filled only with evil desires;
originally, no doubt, he believed he was aiming at good, but gradually
he himself fell victim to the same spell which he exercised
over the masses; because whoever ventures to seduce the masses
is finally led and seduced by them, and so this reciprocal relation
between leader and those led, in my opinion, contributed to
ensnaring him in the evil ways of mass instincts, which every
political leader should avoid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One more thing was to be admired in Hitler. He was a man of
unbending energy, of a will power which overcame all obstacles,
and in my estimate only those two characteristics—mass psychology
and his energy and will power—explain that Hitler was able to
rally up to 40 percent, and later almost 50 percent, of the German
people behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What else shall I say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well, I was mainly concerned with bringing up the
subject of your own change of opinion. You have said that the
break in your attitude toward Hitler was caused by the Fritsch
incident. You are the best witness who can give us an explanation
not of Hitler’s but of your own development and your changing
attitude towards Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Excuse me. I think there is a basic error here. It
appears from this as if I had been a convinced adherent of Hitler
at some time. I was never that. On the contrary, out of concern
for my people and my country, after Hitler gained power, I
endeavored with all my strength to direct that power into an
orderly channel, and to keep it within bounds. Therefore, there
was no question of a break with Hitler. A break could only be
spoken of had I been closely connected with him before. At heart
I was never closely connected with Hitler, but to all appearances
I worked in the Cabinet and I did so because he was after all in
power, and I considered it my duty to put myself at the disposal
of my people and my country for their good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: All right, but at what time, by what conditions, by
what realization were you influenced to begin that activity which
the witness Gisevius has described?
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: My serious criticism of Hitler’s doings started
already at the time of the so-called Röhm Putsch on 30 June 1934.
I should like to point out first that these things occurred quite
unexpectedly and took me by surprise, because I had not at all anticipated
them. At that time I had told Hitler, “How could you have
these people just simply killed off? Under all circumstances there
should have been at least a summary trial of some sort.” Hitler
swallowed these remarks and merely mumbled something about
“revolutionary necessity,” but he did not really contradict me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in the course of the second half of the year 1934 and the
first half of the year 1935 I noticed that I had been under a misconception
when I believed that Hitler did not approve of what might
be considered revolutionary and disorderly Party excesses, and that
he was really willing to restore a respectable atmosphere. Hitler
did nothing to put a stop to the excesses of individual Party
members or Party groups. Very likely the idea which recently—or
I believe today—was mentioned by a witness was always in
his mind: let the SA have its fling for once. That is to say, for the
masses of the Party he sanctioned, as a means of recreation, so to
speak, behavior which is absolutely incompatible with good order
in the State. In the course of the following months my suspicions
were confirmed and increased, and then for the first time, in May
1935, I took occasion to bring these matters up with him quite
openly. I do not know if you want me to discuss these things now,
but I am ready to tell about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I consider it important that the Tribunal should hear
from you how your original attitude towards Hitler, which you
have just described, changed, and you became a conspirator against
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Well, the decisive change in my attitude came about
by reason of the Fritsch incident, at the very moment when I had
to recognize—and, of course, that did not come with lightning
speed, but in the course of weeks and months it crystallized—that
Hitler aimed at war, or at least was not prepared to do everything
to avoid a war. At that moment I told myself that this was a
tremendous danger which was raising its head, and that violence
could be crushed only by violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any opportunity of political propaganda within the German
people was of course out of the question. There was no freedom
of assembly. There was no freedom of speech. There was no freedom
of writing. There was no possibility of discussing things even
in a small group. From beginning to end one was spied upon, and
every word which was said among more than two persons was
spoken at the peril of one’s life. There was only one possibility in
the face of that terror, which was beyond democratic reform and
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>
which barred every national criticism. That was to meet this
situation with violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I came to the conclusion that in the face of Hitler’s terror
only a <span class='it'>coup d’état</span>, a Putsch, and finally an attempt at assassination
was possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And is Gisevius right in saying that the <span class='it'>peripeteia</span>,
the decisive turning point in your attitude resulted from your impressions
and experiences in the so-called Fritsch crisis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Aside from the inherent falsehood which appeared
in all actions and measures of the Party men, the Fritsch crisis
provided the absolute assurance that a basic change was occurring
in the conduct of political affairs, for within about 10 days Blomberg
was removed, Fritsch was removed, Neurath was removed,
and Hitler not only appointed so unsuitable a person as Ribbentrop
to be Foreign Minister, but also in his speech in the Reichstag soon
afterwards announced that from now on rearmament had to be
increased even more. Consequently the Fritsch crisis was the decisive
turning point in my attitude, and from then on I knew that
every further peaceful attempt at controlling the torrent would fail
and that only violent means could meet it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: For an estimate of the Fritsch crisis may I quote now
from the document which I already wanted to produce on the
occasion of the interrogation of Gisevius but could not because the
document was not then available to the Prosecution. The same
view about the Fritsch crisis which Gisevius and now Dr. Schacht
have put here was also expressed abroad by an intelligent officer
with political foresight. May I point to Exhibit Number 15 of my
document book (Document Number Schacht-15)? That is Page 41
of the English text, and 35 of the German text. It is a biennial
report of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army to the
Secretary of War for the period of 1 July 1943 to 30 June 1945. I
quote one sentence from it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The history of the German High Command from 1938 on is
one of constant conflict of personalities, in which military
judgment was increasingly subordinated to Hitler’s personal
dictates. The first clash occurred in 1938 and resulted in the
removal of Von Blomberg, Von Fritsch, and Beck and of the
last effective conservative influence on German foreign
policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So here also that turning point has been clearly understood. And
in summary I would like to ask this question of Dr. Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Were you only disappointed by
Hitler, or did you consider yourself deceived by Hitler at that time?
Will you answer that?
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The answer is that I have never felt disappointed
by Hitler, because I had not expected more of him than my appraisal
of his personality allowed me. But I certainly consider
myself deceived, swindled, and cheated by him to the highest
degree, because whatever he had previously promised to the
German people and thereby to me, he did not keep afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He promised equal rights for all citizens, but his adherents,
regardless of their capabilities, enjoyed privileges before all other
citizens. He promised to put the Jews under the same protection
which foreigners enjoyed, yet he deprived them of every legal
protection. He had promised to fight against political lies, but
together with his Minister Goebbels he cultivated nothing but
political lies and political fraud. He promised the German people
to maintain the principles of positive Christianity yet he tolerated
and sponsored measures by which institutions of the Church were
abused, reviled, and damaged. Also, in the foreign political field
he always spoke against a war on two fronts—and then later
undertook it himself. He despised and disregarded all laws of the
Weimar Republic, to which he had taken the oath when he became
Chancellor. He mobilized the Gestapo against personal liberty. He
gagged and bound all free exchange of ideas and information. He
pardoned criminals and enlisted them in his service. He did everything
to break his promises. He lied to and deceived the world,
Germany, and me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Let us return to the period of the seizure of power.
In November 1932, you stated publicly that Hitler would become
Reich Chancellor. What caused you to make that statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That statement was caused by the fact that Hitler
in the July elections of 1932 obtained 40 percent of all seats in the
Reichstag for his Party. That is an election result which, if I am
informed correctly, had never occurred since 1871, when the Reichstag
was founded; and to me, as a democrat and a follower of
democratic parliamentary government, it was quite inevitable that
that man was now to be entrusted with forming a cabinet. I do not
know of any alternative at the time. There was only one other
possibility, one alternative, and that was a military rule. But the
Cabinet of Von Papen already had had some special presidential
authority and still could not maintain itself in the face of the
Reichstag; and when Herr Schleicher attempted to establish a
military regime without the participation of the Nazis, he failed
after just a few weeks, because he found himself confronted with
the alternative either of starting a civil war or of resigning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hindenburg and at first Schleicher as well—although at the last
moment he acted differently—were always of the opinion that the
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>
Armed Forces could not face a civil war, and Hindenburg was certainly
not ready to tolerate a civil war. But very unwillingly he
saw himself forced by necessity to put the reins of government into
the hands of the man who, thanks to his own propaganda and the
incapability of all preceding governments, thanks also to the inconsiderate
policy of the foreign countries toward Germany, had
won the majority of German votes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You know that the Prosecution accuses you of having
assisted Hitler and the Nazi regime to power. I therefore want to
ask you now whether between the July elections 1932, and the day
when Hitler became Chancellor—that is the 30th of January, 1933—you
spoke publicly for Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I want to state first that Hitler’s power was an
accomplished fact in July 1932, when he secured 230 Reichstag
seats. Everything else that followed must be viewed as a consequence
of that Reichstag election. During that entire period—with
the exception of the one interview you mentioned, in which I said
that according to democratic principles Hitler must become Reich
Chancellor—I can say that I did not write or publicly speak a single
word for Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you, during the time when the reorganization of
the Reich Cabinet was discussed, speak to Hindenburg on behalf of
Hitler’s Chancellorship?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have never in consultations with any of the competent
gentlemen, be it Hindenburg, Meissner, or anyone else,
contributed towards exerting any influence in favor of Hitler, nor
did I participate in any way in the nomination of Hitler to be Reich
Chancellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The prosecutor accuses you in that connection of
putting the prestige of your name at the disposal of Hitler in
November 1932, and he refers to a statement made by Goebbels in
the latter’s book, <span class='it'>From the Kaiserhof to the Reich Chancellery</span>.
What can you say about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I would never have expected that this apostle of
truth, Goebbels, would once more be mobilized against me here,
but it is not my fault if Herr Goebbels made a mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The prosecutor also states that you provided the funds
for Hitler in the Reichstag elections of 5 March; that is said to have
happened in an industrial meeting on which there is an affidavit by
the industrialist Von Schnitzler, Document Number EC-439, Exhibit
USA-618. What do you have to say about that? It is our Number 3
of our document book, Page 11 of the English copy.
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In February of 1933, at the time when Hitler was
already Reich Chancellor and the elections of 5 March were to
furnish a basis for the shape of the new government, Hitler asked
me whether, at the occasion of a meeting which Göring was to call
and which would have the purpose of raising funds for the elections,
I would be good enough to take the role of his banker. I had no
reason for refusing to do that. The meeting took place on 26 February.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the prosecutor has made it appear that during that
meeting I had solicited election funds. The Prosecution themselves,
however, have presented a document, D-203, which apparently is
meant to be a record of the election speech made by Hitler on that
evening...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I interrupt you and point out to the Tribunal that
it is our Exhibit Number Schacht-2, on Page 9 of the English text.
Excuse me. Please, will you kindly go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: D-203. That document closes with the following
sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Göring then passed very cleverly to the necessity that other
circles not taking part in this political battle should at least
make the financial sacrifices required.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore from that report which was submitted by the Prosecution,
it can be seen very clearly that not I but Göring pleaded for
funds. I only administered these funds later, and, in the affidavit by
Schnitzler, Document EC-439, Page 11, the Prosecution have carefully
left out these decisive passages which do not accuse, but exonerate
me. I quote the two sentences, therefore, as follows—I am
sorry, I have to quote in English because I have only the English
text in front of me:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At the meeting Dr. Schacht proposed raising an election fund
of as far as I remember three million Reichsmarks. The fund
was to be distributed between the two ‘allies’ according to
their relative strength at the time. Dr. Stein suggested that
the Deutsche Volkspartei should be included, which suggestion,
if I remember rightly, was accepted. The amounts
which the individual firms were to contribute were not discussed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It can be seen from this that the election fund was not collected
only for the Nazi Party, but for the Nazi Party and the national
group which was its ally and to which, for instance, also Herr Von
Papen and Hugenberg belonged, and which during that very meeting
was extended to comprise a third group, the German People’s
Party. It was, therefore, a collective fund for those parties who
went into the election campaign together, and not just a Nazi fund.
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution have mentioned those laws which
were decreed after the seizure of power, and which introduced and
then established the totalitarian rule of the Nazis and of Hitler. We
have to consider the question of your personal responsibility as a
later member of the cabinet and I must discuss these laws with you
in detail; for the present I just want to remind you of them generally:
First, the Enabling Act; then the law about the prohibition of
parties and the establishment of one Party; the law about the unity
of Party and State; the law decreeing the expropriation of the SPD
and the trade unions; the law about civil service associations; the
law about the legal limitation of professions for Jews; the law
instituting the Peoples’ Court; the law legalizing the murders of
30 June 1934; and the law about the merger of the offices of the
Reich Chancellor and the Reich President in the person of Hitler.
How do you, as a member of the Cabinet, define your personal
responsibility with respect to these laws?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: When all these laws were issued I was not a Cabinet
member. I had no vote in the Cabinet. I had a vote in the Cabinet
only after 1 August 1934, at which time the last disastrous law, the
merger of the offices of Reich Chancellor and Reich President was
decreed. I did not participate in the discussions preceding this law,
nor did I vote on it. I had absolutely no part in any of these laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I do not know whether I mentioned it, but I want to
protect you against a misunderstanding. This does not apply to the
merger of the offices of the Reich President in the person of Hitler,
after Hindenburg’s death?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Of course, I did not take part in that either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And why not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Because I was not then in the Cabinet. I received
my official nomination as Minister on 3 or 4 August. I did not take
part in the deliberations on that law. I did not vote for it, and did
not sign it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: But in the Indictment it is stated that you were a
member of the Reichstag. Then as a member of the Reichstag you
would have voted for these laws, inasmuch as, actually, after 1933
only unanimous votes were cast in the Reichstag?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. Unfortunately, there is much in the trial brief
which is not correct. During my entire life I was never a member
of the Reichstag. One look into the <span class='it'>Reichstag Handbook</span> could have
enlightened the Prosecution that also during that time I was not
a member of the Reichstag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had nothing to do with all these laws either as member of the
Cabinet or of the Reichstag, because I had been neither during that
time.
<span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did Adolf Hitler actually take an oath to the Weimar
Constitution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Of course Hitler took an oath to the Weimar Constitution
when he became Reich Chancellor, to Reich President
Von Hindenburg. In taking that oath he swore not only to respect
the constitution but also to observe and fulfill all laws unless they
were lawfully changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Was the Weimar Constitution ever formally repealed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, the Weimar Constitution has never been repealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In your view was the Leadership Principle established
anywhere legally or constitutionally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The Leadership Principle was not established by a
single law, and the subsequent attempt to reduce the responsibility
of the individual ministers—and that affects me, too—by saying that
it had become prescriptive law, is not correct. The responsibility of
the ministers continued to exist, my own also, and was kept down
only by the terror and the violent threats of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The questions whether the Enabling Act referred to the
Führer or to the Cabinet; whether the first Cabinet after 1933 was
a National Socialist one or a combination of the parties of the right;
and the question of the development of Hitler into an autocratic
dictator, all these I have already put to the witness Lammers. I do
not wish to repeat them, but do you have to add anything new to
what Lammers has testified?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I made only two notes. In Hitler’s Reichstag speech
on 23 March 1933 he said, “It is the sincere desire of the National
Government...”—not the National Socialist, as it is always referred
to later, but the National Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the second point: In the proclamation to the Wehrmacht

the Reichswehr, in accordance with the testament of my

politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This and other factors already mentioned convinced me that
the Cabinet would be a national coalition cabinet, whereas Hitler,
by his rule of terror and violence, formed a pure Nazi dictatorship
out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Before we go on with the case of the Defendant
Schacht, the Tribunal wishes to announce its decision on the
applications by Dr. Sauter on behalf of the Defendant Von Schirach:
The first application to which any objection was taken related to the
group of documents Numbers 30, 31, 45, 68, 73, 101, 124, and 133.
That application with respect to that group of documents is denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next matter was an application in respect of Number 118(a).
That application is granted and the document is to be translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next was Number 121 and in that case the application is
denied. As regard to witnesses, Dr. Sauter withdrew his application
for the witness Marsalek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with the other applications, the Tribunal grants the
application that Uiberreither should be called as a witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yesterday, much to my regret, I neglected after an
answer given by Dr. Schacht to my question as to whether he was
disappointed by Hitler or whether he considered himself deceived
by him, to read a passage from a document which deals with the
same point. I am referring to a document which has been submitted
to the High Tribunal and which has been quoted several times—Exhibit
Schacht-34, Page 114 of the English text of the document
book. This passage may be found on Page 124 of the English document
book and reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Dr. Schacht, even in the years 1935-36, as may have been
seen from numerous statements, had fallen into the role of a
man, who in good faith had put his strength and ability at
Hitler’s disposal but who now felt himself betrayed.</p>

<p>“Of the many statements made by Schacht, I quote only one
which Schacht made at the occasion of a supper with my wife
and myself in the summer of 1938. When Dr. Schacht made
his appearance, it was evident that he was in a state of inner
excitement and during the supper, he suddenly gave vent to
his feelings, when, in deep agitation he almost shouted at my
wife, ‘My dear lady, we have fallen into the hands of criminals—how
could I ever have suspected that?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the affidavit made out by Schniewind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday I mentioned three documents: namely, a speech made
by Schacht on “Geography and Statistics” at Frankfurt-am-Main on
9 December 1936, then an article Schacht had written on the colonial
problem and a speech given at Königsberg by Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to submit these documents: The speech on “Geography
and Statistics” at Frankfurt is the Document Schacht-19, Page 48,
English Page 54. The theme on the colonial question is Exhibit
Schacht-21, German version Page 53 and English version Page 59.
The speech at Königsberg is Exhibit Schacht-25 of my document
book, German version on Page 44 and English version Page 73.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Schacht, we stopped in the middle of 1934, shortly before you
entered the Ministry of Economics, and when you became Minister of
Economics, you were familiar with the happenings of 30 June 1934
and their legalization by the Cabinet. Did you not have any misgivings
to enter the Cabinet or what reasons prompted you to put
aside these misgivings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As far as my personal composure and comfort would
have been concerned, it would have been very simple not to assume
office and to resign. Of course, I asked myself what help that would
be for the future development of German politics if I did refuse
office. We were already at a stage in which any public and open
opposition and criticism against the Hitler regime had been made
impossible. Meetings could not be held, societies could not be established,
every press statement was subject to censorship, and all
political opposition, without which no government can thrive, had
been prevented by Hitler through his policy of terror. There was
only one possible way to exercise criticism and even form an opposition
which could prevent bad and faulty measures being taken by
the Government. And this opposition could solely be formed in the
Government itself. Thus convinced, I entered the Government and
I hoped in the course of the years to find a certain amount of support
and backing among the German people. There was still a large
mass of spiritual leaders, professors, scientists, and teachers, whom
I did not expect simply to acquiesce to a regime of coercion. There
were also many industrialists, leaders of economy, who I did not
assume would bow to a policy of coercion incompatible with free
economy. I expected a certain support from all these circles, support
which would make it possible for me to have a moderating, controlling
influence in the Government. Therefore, I entered Hitler’s
Cabinet, not with enthusiastic assent, but because it was necessary
to keep on working for the German people and exercise a moderating
influence within the Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In the course of time was no opposition ever developed
within the Party?
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In answering that question, I would like to say that
within the Party, of course, the decent elements were by far in
majority; the greater part of the population had joined the Party
because of a healthy instinct and with good intentions driven by
the need in which the German nation found itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to say about the SS, for instance, that in the beginning
numbers of decent people joined the SS because Himmler gave
the SS the appearance of fighting for a life of ideals. I would like
to call your attention to a book written by an SS man which
appeared at that time under the significant title, <span class='it'>Schafft anständige
Kerle</span> (<span class='it'>Let’s Make Decent Men</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, in the course of time, Hitler knew how to gather around
him all bad elements, within the Party and its organization, and to
chain tightly all those elements to himself, because he understood
how to exploit shrewdly any mistake, slip-up, or misdemeanor on
their part. Yesterday I talked about drunkenness as a constituent
part of Nazi ideology; I did not do that with the purpose of degrading
anyone personally. I did it for another quite definite reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of further developments, I observed that even
many Party members who had fallen into this net of Hitler and
who occupied more or less leading positions, gradually became afraid
because of the consequences of the injustices and the evil deeds to
which they were instigated by the regime. I had the definite feeling
that these people resorted to alcohol and various narcotics in order
to flee from their own conscience, and that it was only this flight
from their own conscience that permitted them to act the way they
did. Otherwise, there would be no explanation for the large number
of suicides that took place at the end of the Nazi regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You know that you are accused of being a participant
in a conspiracy which had as its object an illegal violation of the
peace. Did you at any time have secret discussions, or secret orders,
or secret directives, which worked toward this objective?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I may say that I myself never received any order or
fulfilled any wish which might have been contrary to the conception
of right. Never did Hitler request anything from me which he knew
I would surely not carry out because it did not agree with my moral
point of view. But neither did I ever notice or observe that one of
my fellow ministers or one of the other leading men who did not
belong to Hitler’s inner circle—of course, I could not control that
circle—or anyone else whom I met in official contacts, showed in
any way that there was an intent to commit a war crime; on the
contrary, we were always very glad when Hitler came off with one
of his big speeches in which he assured, not only the entire world,
but above all the German people that he was thinking of nothing
except peace and peaceful work. The fact that Hitler deceived the
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>
world and the German people, and many of his co-workers, is one
of the things that I mentioned yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you at any time—of course, I mean outside of your
normal oath of office—take any oath or bind yourself in any other
way to the Party or another National Socialist organization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not a single oath and not a single obligation beyond
my oath of office to the head of the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you have close private relations with leading
National Socialists, for example, with Hitler or Göring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I assume you mean a close friendly or social contact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I never had relations of that sort with Hitler. He
repeatedly urged me in the first years to come to the luncheons at
the Reich Chancellery where he was lunching with closer friends.
I tried to do that twice. I attended twice at various intervals, and
I must say that not only the level of the discussion at the luncheon
and the abject humility shown to Hitler repulsed me but I also did
not like the whole crowd, and I never went back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never called on Hitler personally in a private matter. Of course,
naturally, I attended the large public functions which all the ministers,
the Diplomatic Corps and high officials, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, attended,
but I never had any intimate, social, or other close contact with him.
That applies to the other gentlemen as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of course, in the first months of our acquaintance we
visited each other on occasion, but all so-called social gatherings
which still took place in the first period had a more or less official
character. Close private relations simply did not exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And does this answer apply to all the other leading
National Socialists as well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: All of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When, for instance, did you speak for the last time
with the following persons? Let us start first with Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I gather from the use of the word “first” that you
are going to mention others also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, Himmler, Hess, Ley, and Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In that case I would like to make a few preliminary
remarks: At the close of the French campaign, when Hitler returned
triumphant and victorious from Paris, all of us—the ministers and
the Reichsleiter and the other dignitaries of the Party as I assume,
and state secretaries, and so forth—received an invitation from the
Reich Chancellery to be present at the Anhalter Railway Station to
greet Hitler on his arrival. Since I was in Berlin at the time, it was
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>
impossible for me to refuse this invitation. It was 1940, the conflict
between Hitler and myself had been going on for some time, and it
would have been a veritable affront if I had stayed at home. Consequently,
I went to the station and saw a very large number of Party
dignitaries, ministers and so forth, but, of course, I do not remember
any more just who all these people were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I beg your pardon for interrupting you. I have a rather
poor memory for films and especially for newsreels, but I believe
that that reception was shown in a newsreel and I believe that you
were just about the only civilian who was present among those
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I personally did not see that film, but my friends
told me about it. They mentioned especially that among all the gold
braid, I was the only civilian in street clothes there. Of course, it
could be ascertained from the film who was present at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mentioned this reception, for it might be possible that I said
“Good morning” to many people and inquired about their health
and so forth, and I also recall that I arrived at the station with the
Codefendant Rosenberg in the same car, because there were always
two people to a car. I did not attend the reception which followed
at the Reich Chancellery. Rosenberg did go but I said, “No, I would
rather not go. I am going home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then, I may assume that you probably saw the leading
men, Hess, Ley, Ribbentrop, Rosenberg, Frick, Frank, Schirach, Speer,
Sauckel, Seyss-Inquart, Kaltenbrunner, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, then for the last
time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It is possible that all these gentlemen were there,
but I did not speak at length with any of them except Hitler himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you speak with Hitler at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Hitler addressed me, and that was one of the strangest
scenes of my life. We were all standing in line and Hitler passed
everyone by rather quickly. When he saw me, he came up to me
with a triumphant smile and extended his hand in a cordial manner,
something which I had not seen from him for a long time, and he
said to me, “Now, Herr Schacht, what do you have to say now?” Then,
of course, he expected me to congratulate him or express my admiration
or a similar sentiment, and to admit that my prognostication
about the war and about the disaster of the war was wrong,
for he knew my attitude about the war quite exactly. It was
extremely hard for me to avoid such an answer and I searched my
mind for something else to say, finally replying: “I can only say to
you, ‘God protect you.’ ” That was the only significant conversation
which I had that day. I believed the best way to have kept my
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>
distance was through just such a completely neutral and inconsequential
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: But perhaps you would like me to refer to the individual
gentlemen, and I can tell you with this exception just when
I spoke to these gentlemen for the last time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Himmler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Himmler, I would judge that perhaps I talked to him
last in 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Hess?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Hess—of course I am not referring to the conversations
here in the prison. I had not spoken with Hess for years
before the beginning of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Ley?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Ley, I had not seen him since the beginning of
the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Ribbentrop?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I saw Ribbentrop last after my being thrown out of
the Reichsbank, because I had to talk with him about the imminent
journey to India, and that must have been, I would judge, February
1939. I have not talked with him since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Rosenberg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Rosenberg, always aside from this reception of Hitler’s,
perhaps not since 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I perhaps saw Frick last in the year 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Schirach?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not even know Schirach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Speer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I talked with Speer for the last time—and I can tell
you this exactly—when I went to the World Exposition in Paris in
the year 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Of course, you are always referring to the time before
you were taken prisoner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, of course, naturally here I have...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Sauckel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not since the beginning of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Seyss-Inquart?
<span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Seyss-Inquart, I would judge that I spoke to him
for the last time in 1936, when I visited a colleague in the National
Bank in Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Kaltenbrunner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I saw Kaltenbrunner for the first time here at the
prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We will refer to Hitler later. Frank is still missing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I saw Frank last perhaps 1937 or 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Most likely at the occasion of the speech you mentioned
yesterday?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, possibly also afterwards at an official reception,
but I do not believe that I saw him after 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, how about the leading men of the Wehrmacht,
Keitel, for instance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I never had any contact with Keitel. I perhaps saw
him at some social gathering, but never after 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Jodl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I made Herr Jodl’s acquaintance here in the prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dönitz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I met Dönitz for the first time here in the prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Raeder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Herr Raeder, I believe I have known him for quite
some time. In the beginning we exchanged occasional visits within
the family, visits of a semiofficial character but always on a friendly
basis; however, I believe that I have also not seen him or talked
to him since 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Brauchitsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have not talked with Brauchitsch since 1939, or
since 1938, since the Fritsch affair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How about Halder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As you know, I saw Halder in connection with the
Putsch in the fall of 1938 but not after that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How often did you see Hitler after your dismissal as
President of the Reichsbank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: After my dismissal as President of the Reichsbank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Since January 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I saw him once more in January 1939 because I had
to discuss my future activity, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, with him. And on that occasion
he asked me—he knew that I had long wished to take an
extensive journey—that I might avail myself of this opportunity to
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>
take this journey now, so there would not be so much talk about my
leaving the Reichsbank. Then we agreed on the trip to India. On
that occasion I also saw Göring for the last time. And then—after
my return in August, I did not see him again—then the war came,
during the course of which I saw him twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shall I tell you about those two occasions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I saw him once in February 1940. At that time
various American magazines and periodicals had requested me to
write articles on Germany’s interpretation of the situation, her
desires, and her position in general. I had the inclination to do this,
but because we were at war, I naturally could not do so without
first informing the Foreign Minister. The Foreign Minister advised
me that he had nothing against my writing an article for an American
periodical, but that before sending off this article, he wanted
to have the article submitted for censorship. Of course that did not
appeal to me—I had not even thought of that—and, consequently,
I did not write this article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, there were further inquiries from America and I said
to myself, “It is not sufficient for me to talk with the Foreign
Minister, I must go to Hitler in this matter.” So, with that aim,
I called on Hitler, who received me very soon after my request,
and I told him at that time, among other things, just what my
experience with Herr Von Ribbentrop had been, and I further told
him that I thought it might be quite expedient to write these
articles; and that it seemed vital to me to have constantly someone
in America, who by means of the press, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, could enlighten
public opinion as to Germany and her interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler was favorably impressed with this suggestion of mine
and said to me, “I shall discuss this matter with the Foreign
Minister.” Consequently, this entire matter came to naught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, later, through the good offices of my Codefendant, Funk,
who probably had a discussion at that time with Ribbentrop about
this matter, I tried to get at least an answer from Ribbentrop. This
answer, given to Funk, was to the effect that it was still too early
for a step of that sort. And that was my visit in 1940. Then I saw
Hitler again in February of 1941...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Pardon my interruption. So that we can avoid all
misunderstandings, if Hitler had given you permission that you
could have gone to America, just what would your activities have
been? Tell us very briefly. I want no misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: First of all, I had not proposed going myself; I
rather made a general suggestion. But, naturally, I would have
been very glad to go to America for I saw a possibility...
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not think it is material
to know what he would have done if something had happened
which did not happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I just wanted to preclude any misunderstanding. I
said that misunderstandings—Well let us drop the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Then, let us go on to your second
visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In 1941, in February, I called on Hitler once more
because of a private affair. The year before my wife had died and
now I intended to remarry. As Minister without Portfolio, which
I still was, I naturally had to inform the Reich Chancellor and head
of the State of my intention and I called on him for that reason.
There was no political discussion on this occasion. As I was going
to the door, he asked me, “At one time you had the intention, or
you advised me, that someone should go to America. It is probably
too late for that, now.” I replied immediately, “Of course, it is
too late for that now.” And that was the only remark of a political
nature made. The conversation dealt mainly with my marriage,
and since then I did not see Hitler any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And now your relations with Göring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not see Göring either since 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, I am turning to a point which has been repeatedly
stressed by the Prosecution, that is, the propaganda value of
your participation at Party rallies, and I would like to remind
you of what Mr. Justice Jackson has already mentioned in his
opening statement. I am translating from the English because I
have no German text:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Does anyone believe that Hjalmar Schacht, seated in the
first row at the Nazi Party Rally of 1935 and wearing the
Party emblem, was only included in the film for the purpose
of making an artistic effect? This great thinker, in lending
his name to this threadbare undertaking, gave it respectability
in the eyes of every hesitating German.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Will you please state your opinion on this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: First of all, I would like to make a few minor
corrections. In 1935 I did not have a Party emblem. Secondly,
Germans who were hesitating were no longer of any importance
in 1935, for Hitler’s domination had been firmly established by
1935. There were only those people who were turning away from
Hitler but none who were still coming to him. And then, I must
really consider it as a compliment that I am called a figure of
importance, a great thinker, and so forth; but I believe that the
reasons for my being and working in the Hitler Cabinet have
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>
been set forth by me in sufficient detail, so that I need not go
into that any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that in the first years especially I could not very
well absent myself from the Party rallies is understandable, I
believe, for they were Hitler’s principal display of show and
ostentation for the outside world, and not only did his ministers
participate in the Party rallies but also a great many other representative
guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I add just a few more words?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stayed away from the later Party rallies. For example, the
Party Rally of 1935 mentioned by the Chief Prosecutor. That was
the Party rally—and this is why I happen to remember it—at
which the Nuremberg Laws against the Jews were proclaimed, and
at the time I was not even in Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I attended the Party Rally in 1933 and in 1934. I am not certain
whether I attended it in 1936 or 1937. I rather believe that I
attended in 1936. I was decidedly missing at the later rallies and
the last visit that I made at the Party Rally, which I have just
mentioned, I attended only on “Wehrmacht Day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: At these Party Rallies were the prominent foreigners—you
already mentioned that. Was the Diplomatic Corps represented
by the chiefs of the diplomatic missions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I believe that with the exception of the Soviet
Ambassador, in the course of years all other leading diplomats
attended the Party Rally, and I must say, in large numbers, with
great ostentation and seated in the first rows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How did you explain that? The Diplomatic Corps
only really takes part in functions of State and this was a purely
Party matter? How was this participation explained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think this is objectionable. If it
please the Tribunal, I am in a position to object, because I am not
embarrassed by it, if there is any embarrassment, but for this witness
to explain the conduct of the ambassadors of other countries
seems utterly beyond probative value. His opinion of what the
ambassadors were doing, why they attended a Party rally which
he was lending his name to, doesn’t seem to me has any probative
value. The fact that they attended I don’t object to, but it seems
to me that for him to probe, unless he has some fact—and I want
to make clear I don’t object to any facts that this witness knows,
and I haven’t objected to most of his opinions which we have been
getting at great length. But I think for him to characterize the
action of foreign representatives is going beyond the pale of relevant
and material evidence.
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I make just one remark in reply?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we had better pass on, Dr. Dix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, of course. However, I would ask to be given
the permission to answer Mr. Justice Jackson briefly, not because
I want to be stubborn, but I believe that if I answer now I can
avoid later discussions and can save time thereby. I did not ask
the defendant for his opinion. Of course Mr. Justice Jackson
is right in saying that he is not here to give opinions about the
customs of the Diplomatic Corps; but I asked him about a fact:
How this participation on the part of the Diplomatic Corps, which
is significant, was explained at that time. I consider this relevant,
as will be seen more than once in the course of my questioning,
and that is why I am saying it now, that throughout his and his
political friends’ oppositional activities, it is of prime importance
to know who gave them moral, spiritual, or any other support,
and who did not support them. And thereby, of course, the outward
demeanor of the official representatives of foreign countries during
the whole period is of tremendous importance, with regard to the
capacity of this opposition group to act. One can support such a
group; one can be neutral to it, or one can also combat it from
abroad. That is the only reason why I put my question, and I
deem myself obligated to consider this angle of the problem also
in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, I don’t think Mr. Justice Jackson’s
objection was to the fact that the diplomatic representatives were
there but to comment upon the reasons why they were there. If
all you want to prove is the fact that they were there, then I don’t
think Mr. Justice Jackson was objecting to that. What the defendant
was going on to give, was his opinion of why the diplomatic
representatives were there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I believe I do not need to make a further reply. He
has already said that he does not wish to give an explanation, but
if Your Lordship will permit me, I shall continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Around that time, you certainly
came into contact with prominent foreigners both officially and
privately. What position did they take towards the trend of events
at the time the National Socialists consolidated their power? And
how did their attitude influence your own attitude and activity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: May it please the Tribunal! I dislike
to interrupt with objections, but I can’t see how it exonerates or
aids this defendant, that prominent foreigners may have been
deceived by a regime for which he was furnishing the window
dressings with his own name and prestige. Undoubtedly there
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span>
were foreigners, I am willing to stipulate there were foreigners,
like Dahlerus, who were deceived by this set-up of which he was
a prominent and slightly respectable part. But it does seem to
me that if we are going to go into the attitude of foreigners who
are not indicted here or accused that we approach endless questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I see no relevance in this sort of testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question is here, as I have tried to point out to Dr. Dix,
the sole thing that is charged against this defendant is that he
participated in the conspiracy to put this nation into war and
to carry out the War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity incidental
to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I can’t see how the attitude of foreigners either exonerates
or helps the Court to decide that question. If it does, of course
I don’t object to it, but I can’t see the importance of it at this stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I do believe that Mr. Justice Jackson...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute, Dr. Dix, what exactly was
the question that you were asking at that moment? What had it
reference to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I asked the witness what the attitude was that was
taken by prominent foreigners with whom he came into contact at
that time, officially and privately during the period that the regime
consolidated its power. Did they reject the regime, or were they
sympathetic to it? In other words, just how far did these foreigners
influence him and his thinking? And may I...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you know, Dr. Dix, that to ask one
witness what the attitude of other people is is a very much too
general form of question. Attitude—what does the word mean?
It is far too general, and I do not understand exactly what you
are trying to prove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I will make the question more precise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How, Dr. Schacht, through your exchange of thoughts with foreigners,
was your personal attitude influenced? How was your
attitude and your activity influenced through the attitude of these
foreigners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the Tribunal.</span>] That is something which Dr. Schacht
can testify to alone, because it is of an intimate nature and personal
to Schacht. Your Lordship, I want quite openly to state the point
to be proved which seems very relevant to the Defense and on
which this question is based. I do not wish to conceal anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, the Defense, maintain that this oppositional group—about
which Gisevius has already spoken, and of which Schacht was a
prominent member—that this group not only received no support
from abroad, but that foreigners rendered the opposition more
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>
difficult. That is not a criticism that is leveled towards foreign
governments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no doubt that the representatives of these countries
took that attitude in good faith and with a sense of duty in the
service of their countries. But it was of decisive value for the
attitude of these men of this oppositional group what position the
foreign countries took to this regime; whether they respected or
whether they supported it by precedence given its representatives,
socially, as far as possible, or, through caution and reserve,
showed their disinclination to it, thereby strengthening this oppositional
group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This evidence is of the utmost importance to me in the carrying
on of the defense. I have stated it quite openly, and, as much as
I can, I will fight for this piece of evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, the Tribunal has considered the
argument which you have presented to it and they think that the
investigation of these facts is a waste of time and is irrelevant.
They will, therefore, ask you to go on with the further examination
of the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Schacht, you supported the rearmament through
financing by the Reichsbank. Why did you do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I considered that Germany absolutely had to have
political equality with other nations, and I am of the same opinion
today; and in order to reach this state, it was necessary that either
the general disarmament which had been promised by the Allied
powers would come into effect, or that if equal rights were to be
obtained Germany would have to rearm on a corresponding scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Was this financial help by the Reichsbank your work
alone or was that decreed through the Directorate of the Reichsbank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In the Reichsbank, the Leadership Principle was
never applied; I rejected the Leadership Principle for the Reichsbank.
The Reichsbank was governed by a group of men all of
whom had an equal power to vote and if there was a “tie,” the
vote of the chairman was the decisive vote, and beyond that the
chairman had no rights in this board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You are familiar with the affidavit of the former
Reichsbank Director Puhl. Did—I put the question taking into
consideration the contents of this affidavit with which the Tribunal
is acquainted—Puhl also participate in giving financial help from
the Reichsbank for rearmament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Herr Puhl participated in all decisions which were
made by the Reichsbank Directorate on this question and not
once did he oppose the decision reached.
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is known to you that the Reichsbank’s method
of financing consisted in the discounting of the so-called mefo bills.
The Prosecution have discussed this fact in detail and the afore-mentioned
affidavit signed by Puhl says that this method made
it possible to keep the extent of rearmament secret. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: We cannot even talk about keeping the armament
a secret. I call your attention to some excerpts from documents
presented and submitted by the Prosecution themselves as exhibits.
I quote first of all from the affidavit by George Messersmith, dated
30 August 1945, Document Number 2385-PS, where it says on Page 3,
Line 19: “Immediately after the Nazis came into power they started
a vast rearmament program.” And on Page 8 it says: “The huge
German armament program which was never a secret....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Mr. George Messersmith, who was in Berlin at the
time, knew about these matters and I am sure, informed his colleagues
also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continue quoting from Document Number EC-461. It is the
diary of Ambassador Dodd, where it says, under 19 September 1934,
and I quote in English for I just have the English text before me:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When Schacht declared that the Germans are not arming
so intensively, I said: Last January and February Germany
bought from American aircraft people one million dollars
worth of high-class war flying machinery and paid in gold.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is from a conversation between Dodd and myself which
took place in September 1934 and he points out that already in
January and February 1934 war aircraft...</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The proceedings were interrupted by technical difficulties in
the lighting system.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal would like to know how long
you expect to be with your examination-in-chief of the defendant.
You have already been nearly a whole day, and the Tribunal think,
in view of the directions in the Charter, that the examination of
the defendant ought to finish certainly in a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, there are two things I do not like
to do, to make prophecies which do not come true and to make a
promise I cannot keep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I answer the question by saying that I consider it quite
impossible for me to finish today. I am fully aware of the rules
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
of the Charter, but on the other hand I am asking you to consider
that the Prosecution have tried to prove the accusations
against Schacht by numerous pieces of evidence, directly and
indirectly relevant facts, and that it is my duty to deal with these
individual pieces of evidence offered by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Please apply strict measures to my questions and if the Tribunal
should be of the opinion that there is something irrelevant, then
I shall certainly adhere to their ruling. However, I do think that
I have not only the right, but also the duty to put any questions
which are necessary to refute the evidence submitted by the
Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall, therefore, certainly not be able to finish today. I think—I
should be extremely grateful if you would not make me prophesy,
it may go faster and tomorrow I may finish in the course of the
day but it may even take the whole day—I cannot say for certain.
In any case, I shall make every effort to put only relevant questions.
If the Tribunal should be of the opinion that something is not
relevant, I ask to be told so after I have explained my standpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you had better get on at once then,
Dr. Dix, and we’ll tell you when we think your questions are
too long or too irrelevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, Dr. Schacht, we were considering the mefo bills,
did you consider them as a suitable means of keeping the rearmament
secret? Have you anything else to say to that question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The mefo bills as such, as far as rearmament was
concerned, had of course no connection with the question of secrecy,
for the mefo bills were used to pay every supplier. And there
were, of course, hundreds and thousands of small and big suppliers
all over the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from that, before they could be taken to the Reichsbank,
the mefo bills circulated among the public for at least 3 months
and the suppliers who required cash used the mefo bills to discount
them in their banks or to have advances made on the strength
of them, so that all banks participated in this system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I should like to add also that all the mefo bills, which
were taken up by the Reichsbank, were listed on the bill account
of the Reichsbank. Furthermore, I should like to say that the
keeping secret of State expenditure—and armament expenditures
were State expenditure—was not a matter for the President of
the Reichsbank but an affair concerning the Reich Minister of
Finance. If the Reich Minister of Finance did not publish the
guarantees which he had accepted for the mefo bills, then that
was his affair and not mine. I am not responsible for that. The
responsibility for that lies with the Reich Minister of Finance.
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The next question, Your Lordship, might arouse doubts
as to its relevancy. I personally consider it irrelevant for the verdict
in this Trial. However, it has been mentioned by the Prosecution,
and for that reason alone I think it is my duty to give Dr. Schacht
an opportunity to reply and to justify himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution have represented the view that the financing
by means of mefo bills, from the point of view of a solid financial
procedure, was also very hazardous. One might adopt the view that
that may have been the case or not to make this verdict...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Ask the question, Dr. Dix, ask the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You have heard what I have in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It goes without saying that in normal times and
under normal economic conditions such means as mefo bills would
not have been resorted to. But if there is an emergency, then
it has always been customary, and it has always been a policy
recommended by all experts, that the issuing bank should furnish
cheap money and credits so that the economic system can, in turn,
continue to function.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mefo bills, of course, were a thoroughly risky operation, but
they were absolutely not risky if they were connected with a
reasonable financial procedure and to prove this I would say that
if Herr Hitler, after 1937, had used the accruing funds to pay
back the mefo bills, as had been intended—the money was available—then
this system would have come to its end just as smoothly
as I had put it in operation. But Herr Hitler preferred simply to
refuse to pay the bills back, and instead to invest the money in
further armament. I could not foresee that someone would break
his word in such a matter too, a purely business matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: But, if the Reich had met the bills and had paid, then
means would no doubt have partly been lacking for further rearmaments
and the taking up of the bills would therefore have
curtailed armament. Is that a correct conclusion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That, of course, was the very purpose of my wanting
to terminate the procedure. I said if the mefo bills were not met,
it would obviously show ill-will; then there would be further
rearming, and that cannot be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Earlier you briefly dealt with the question of keeping
armament secret in another connection. Have you anything to
add to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think in a general manner it must be realized
that State expenditures do not come under the jurisdiction of
the President of the Reichsbank, and that the expenses and receipts
of the State are under the control of the Reich Minister of Finance,
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>
and consequently the responsibility lies in his hands and it is
his duty to publish the figures. Every bill which the Reichsbank
had in its possession was made known every week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Is that what you have to add to your answer to the
basic question of allegedly keeping the armament program secret?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You have also already explained on the side why you
fundamentally were in favor of rearmament. Have you anything
to add to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. A few very important remarks are, of course,
to be made on that and since this question concerns the chief
accusation against me, I may perhaps deal with it in greater detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I considered an unarmed Germany in the center of Europe, surrounded
by armed nations, as a menace to peace. I want to say
that these states were not only armed but that they were, to a very
large part, continuing to arm and arming anew. Especially two
states which had not existed before, Czechoslovakia and Poland,
were beginning to arm, and England, for example, was continuing
to rearm, specifically with reference to her naval rearmament in
1935, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to say quite briefly that I myself was of the opinion
that a country which was not armed could not defend itself, and
that consequently it would have no voice in the concert of nations.
The British Prime Minister Baldwin once said, in 1935:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“A country which is not willing to take necessary precautionary
measures for its own defense will never have power
in this world, neither moral power nor material power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I considered the inequality of status between the countries surrounding
Germany and Germany as a permanent moral and
material danger to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I further want to point out—and this is not meant to be criticism,
but merely a statement of fact—that Germany, after the Treaty of
Versailles, was in a state of extreme disorganization and confusion.
Conditions in Europe were such that, for example, a latent conflict
and controversy existed between Russia and Finland and between
Russia and Poland which had considerable parts of Russian territory.
There was Russia’s latent conflict with Romania which
had Bessarabia, and then Romania had a conflict with Bulgaria
about the Dobruja and one with Hungary about Siebenbürgen.
There were conflicts between Serbia and Hungary, and between
Hungary and nearly all her neighbors and between Bulgaria and
Greece. In short all of Eastern Europe was in a continuous state
of mutual suspicion and conflict of interests.
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, there was the fact that in a number of countries
there were most serious internal conflicts. I remind you of the
conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks. I remind you of
the civil war conditions in Spain. All that will make it possible
to understand that I considered it absolutely essential that in the
event of the outbreak of any conflagration in this devil’s punch
bowl, it was an absolute necessity for Germany to protect at least
her neutral attitude. That could not possibly be done with that
small army of 100,000 men. For that an adequate army had to
be created.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here in prison I accidentally came across an edition of the
<span class='it'>Daily Mail</span>, dated April 1937, where the conditions in Europe were
described, and I beg you to allow me to quote one single sentence.
I shall have to quote it in English. It does not represent the views
of the <span class='it'>Daily Mail</span>; it only describes conditions in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“All observers are agreed that there is continual peril of an
explosion and that the crazy frontiers of the peace treaties
cannot be indefinitely maintained. Here, too, rigorous non-interference
should be the King of the British chariot. What
vital interests have we in Austria or in Czechoslovakia,
or in Romania, or in Lithuania or Poland?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This merely describes the seething state of Europe at that
time, and in this overheated boiling pot which was always on the
point of exploding, there was Germany, unarmed. I considered
that a most serious danger to my country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I shall probably be asked whether I considered Germany
threatened in any way. No, Gentlemen of the Tribunal, I did not
consider Germany threatened directly with an attack, nor was I of
the opinion that Russia was likely to attack Germany. However, for
example, we had experienced the invasion of the Ruhr in 1923 and
these past events and the actual situation made it imperative for me
to demand equality for Germany and to support a policy that would
attempt to achieve this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I assume that we shall deal with the reasons for the carrying
out of the rearmament and with the reaction of foreign countries,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What did you know at the time about Germany’s efforts
to cause the other nations to disarm? Did that have anything to do
with your decisions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Let me tell you the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fundamentally, I was not in favor of rearmament. I only wanted
equality for Germany. That German equality could be brought
about either by means of disarmament on the part of the other
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>
nations or by our own rearmament. I would have preferred, in fact
I desired disarmament on the part of the others, which anyway had
been promised to us. Consequently I most zealously tried all along
for years to prevent a rearmament, if general disarmament could be
brought about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disarmament on the part of the others did not take place,
although the Disarmament Committee of the League of Nations had
repeatedly declared that Germany had met her obligations regarding
disarmament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To all of us who were members of the so-called National Government
at the time, and to all Germans who participated in political
life, it was a considerable relief that during the first years Hitler,
again and again, strove for and suggested general disarmament.
Afterwards, of course, it is easy to say that that was a false pretense
and a lie on Hitler’s part, but that false pretense and that lie would
have blown up quite quickly if the countries abroad had shown the
slightest inclination to take up these suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember quite well what was told Foreign Minister Eden of
Great Britain when he visited Germany at the beginning of 1934,
because I was present at the social festivities. Quite concrete proposals
concerning Germany’s obligations in all disarmament questions,
in case disarmament on the part of the others was begun and carried
out, were made to him. It was promised to Eden that all so-called
half-military units, like the SS, the SA, and the Hitler Youth, would
be deprived of their military character if only the general disarmament
could be accelerated by those means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could produce a number of quotations regarding these offers to
disarm, but since it is the wish of the President not to delay the
proceedings, I can forego that. They are all well-known statements
made by statesmen and ministers, ambassadors, and such, all of
which have the same tenor, namely, that it was absolutely essential
that the promise made by the Allies should be kept; in other words,
that disarmament should be carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Excuse me if I interrupt you, but we can do it more
quickly and more simply by asking the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of Exhibit Number Schacht-12, which I have been granted,
without my reading it, Page 31 of the English translation of my
document book. These are pertinent remarks and speeches made by
Lord Cecil and others, by the Belgian Foreign Minister, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.
There is no need to read them; they can be presented. I just hear
that they have been presented, and I can refer to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pardon me, please. Continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Well, in that case I am finished with my statement.
Hitler made still further offers but the other countries did not take
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>
up a single one of these offers, and thus, unfortunately, only one
alternative remained, and that was rearmament. That rearmament
carried out by Hitler was financed with my assistance, and I assume
responsibility for everything I have done in that connection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Do I understand you correctly? Can one draw the conclusion
from your statement that there were other reasons for your
assistance in the rearmament program, that you had the tactical
consideration that, by putting German rearmament up for discussion,
the debate on disarmament amongst the other governments might
be started again? This debate, so to say, had died down?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: If I may, I will illustrate it briefly by means of an
example:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two parties have a contract with each other. One party does not
live up to that contract, and the other party has no way of making
him fulfill his obligations. Thus the other party can do nothing
except, in turn, not adhere to the contract. That is what Germany
did. That is what I supported. Now, of course, I must say that I
had expected a type of reaction which in such a case must always
be expected from the partner to a contract, namely, that he would
say, “Well, if you do not keep up the contract either, then we shall
have to discuss this contract again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must say—and I can quite safely use the word—it was a disappointment
to me that Germany’s rearmament was not in any way
replied to by any actions from the Allies. This so-called breach of
contract on Germany’s part against the Versailles Treaty was taken
quite calmly. A note of protest was all; nothing in the least was
done, apart from that, to bring up again the question of disarmament
in which I was interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only was Germany allowed to go on rearming but the Naval
Agreement with Great Britain did, in fact, give Germany the legal
right to rearm contrary to the Versailles Treaty. Military missions
were sent to Germany to look at this rearmament, and German military
displays were visited and everything else was done, but nothing
at all was done to stop Germany’s rearmament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If the Tribunal please, I cannot see
the point of all this detail. We have conceded that rearmament here,
except as it was involved with aggressive purposes, is immaterial.
As I said in the opening, the United States does not care to try here
the issues of European politics, nor are they submitted to this Tribunal
for decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sole question here is the Indictment, charging arming with
the purpose of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not want to interfere with the defendant giving any facts
that bear on his aggressive intentions, but the details of negotiations,
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>
of European politics and charges and countercharges between governments,
it seems to me, lies way back of any inquiry that we could
possibly make, and the details of this matter seem to me not helpful
to the solution of the issues here, and I think was ruled out by the
Tribunal in the case of Göring, if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Dix, it all seems to be a matter of
argument, and argument isn’t really the subject of evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I do not believe so, Your Lordship. What Mr. Justice
Jackson said is quite correct. Schacht is accused of having assisted
in bringing about an aggressive war, but this assistance of his is
supposed to have consisted in the financing which he carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, Dr. Dix, and do try to make it as short
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I think you had come to the end of that question
anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I refer in this connection to one of the motives for
Dr. Schacht’s assistance in rearmament. It was his hope to renew
the debate on disarmament. May I draw your attention to Exhibit
Number Schacht-36, Page 141 of the German text, and Page 149 of
the English text? It is an affidavit from Dr. Schacht’s son-in-law,
Dr. Von Scherpenberg. On Page 2 of that affidavit you will find the
following brief paragraph which I propose to read; in fact, I can
confine myself to one sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He”—that is to say, Schacht—“considered rearmament within
certain limits to be the only means for the re-establishing of
the disturbed equilibrium and the only means of inducing
the other European powers to participate in a limitation
of armaments which, in opposition to the Versailles Treaty,
they had sought to avoid.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is a statement of Scherpenberg regarding conversations
which Schacht had had at that time. It is, therefore, not an <span class='it'>ex
post facto</span> opinion; it is the report of a conversation which he,
Scherpenberg, had with his father-in-law Schacht at that time. That
is just an additional remark I wanted to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You have spoken about the rearmament
on the part of the other states, particularly Czechoslovakia and
Poland, but can you tell us whether at the time you knew of or
heard any exact details regarding the state of armament of those
two states?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I know only that it was known about Russia that in
1935 she announced that her peacetime army should be increased to
960,000 men.
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I knew that in Czechoslovakia, for instance, the installation
of airdromes was one of the leading tasks of rearmament. We knew
that Great Britain’s Navy was to be stepped up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you later on completely abandon your idea of general
disarmament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: To the contrary, I used every opportunity, in particular
during conversations with men from abroad, to say that the
aim should always be disarmament, that, of course, rearmament
would always mean an economic burden for us, which we considered
a most unpleasant state of affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember a conversation which I had with the American Ambassador
Davies. His report of this conversation is incorporated in
an exhibit that has been submitted to the Tribunal. It is an entry
in a diary which is repeated in his book, <span class='it'>Mission to Moscow</span>, and it
is dated as early as 20 June 1937, Berlin. He is writing about the
fact that among other things he and I had talked about disarmament
problems, and I need only quote one sentence. I do not have the
number of the document, Your Lordship, but it has been submitted
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is Exhibit Schacht-18, German Page 43, English
Page 49.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Since I have only the English text, I shall read
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Davies writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When I outlined the President’s (Roosevelt) suggestion of
limitation of armament to defensive weapons only, such as
a man could carry on his shoulder, he (means Schacht) almost
jumped out of his seat with enthusiasm.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It becomes clear, therefore, from Ambassador Davies’ remark
that I was most enthusiastic about this renewed attempt and the
possibility of an imminent step towards disarmament as proposed
by President Roosevelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this same book, Davies reports a few days later on 26 June
1937 about the conversation he had with me, in a letter addressed
to the President of the United States. I quote only one very brief
paragraph—in English again:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I then stated to him (that is, Schacht) that the President in
conversation with me had analyzed the European situation
and had considered that a solution might be found in an
agreement among the European nations to a reduction of
armaments to a purely defensive military basis and this
through the elimination of aircraft, tanks, and heavy equipment,
and the limitation of armaments to such weapons only
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>
as a man could carry on his back, with an agreement among
the nations for adequate policing of the plan by a neutral
state. Schacht literally jumped at the idea. He said: ‘That’s
absolutely the solution.’ He said that in its simplicity it had
the earmarks of great genius. His enthusiasm was extraordinary.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: To what extent did you want rearmament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not beyond equality with every single one of our
neighbor states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And did Hitler talk to you of far-reaching intentions,
or did you hear of any?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: At no time did he tell them to me, nor did I hear
from anyone else, whether he had made remarks about further
intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Were you informed about the extent, the type and speed
of rearmament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, I was never told about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Had you set yourself a limit regarding this financing
or were you prepared to advance any amount of money?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I was certainly, by no means, ready to advance any
unlimited amount of money, particularly as these were not contributions;
they were credits which had to be repaid. The limits for
these credits were twofold. One was that the Reichsbank was independent
of the State finance administration, and the supreme authority
of the State as far as the granting of the credits was concerned.
The Board of Directors of the Reichsbank could pass a resolution
that credits were to be given, or were not to be given, or that credits
were to be stopped, if they considered it right, and as I was perfectly
certain of the policy of the Board of Directors of the Reichsbank—all
of these gentlemen agreed with me perfectly on financial
and banking policy—this was the first possibility of applying a
brake, if I considered it necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second safeguard—limit was contained in the agreement
which the Minister of Finance, the Government, and of course Hitler
had made—the mefo bills, of which these credits consisted, were to
be paid back when they expired. They were repayable after 5 years,
and I have already said that if the repayments had been made, funds
for rearmament would naturally have had to decrease. Therein lay
the second possibility of limiting the rearmament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Will you please give now to the Tribunal the figures
which you were dealing with at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: We went up to...
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We have no desire to enter into controversy
about the figures of financing rearmament. It seems that the
detail of dollars and cents or Reichsmarks is unimportant to this,
and terribly involved. We aren’t trying whether it cost too much
or too little; the purpose of this rearmament is the only question we
have in mind. I don’t see that the statistics of cost have anything
to do with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, we would like to know what figures
the accused and you are talking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The amounts that Schacht as President of the Reichsbank
was ready to grant for the rearmament program; that, no
doubt, is relevant, because if those amounts remained within such
limits as might possibly be considered adequate for defensive
rearmaments in case of emergency, then, of course, the extent of
that financial assistance is a very important piece of evidence
regarding the intentions which Schacht was pursuing at the time.
That is the very thing that, in the case of Schacht, Mr. Justice
Jackson considers relevant, namely, whether he helped prepare for
an aggressive war. If he were considering only the possibility of a
defensive war in his financing and placed only sums at the disposal
of the rearmament program which would never have allowed an
aggressive war, then that would refute the accusation raised by the
Prosecution against the defendant, and I think that the relevance of
that question cannot be doubted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you saying that if the Defendant Schacht
placed at the disposal of the Reich, say, 100 millions, or whatever
the figure is, it would be defensive, and if he placed 150 millions, it
would be not defensive, or what? Is it simply the amount?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: No, I want to say that if, as will be proved, he only
wanted to give 9 and later on gave hesitatingly and unwillingly
12 millions for the purpose, then that contribution can never have
been aimed at an aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is simply the amount?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, only the size of the amount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, that can be stated very shortly, but as
for details of finance...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I am also of the opinion that we have talked about it
too long. I was only going to ask, “What amount did you give?”
and then the objection was raised, and thus the discussion was
drawn out. May I put the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Well, then, what amount
did you intend to grant?
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Naturally as little as possible; however, what I contributed
is what is decisive. I placed at their disposal—to give one
figure and to be very brief—until 31 March 1938, credits amounting
to a total of 12,000,000,000 Reichsmark. I have discussed that with
one of the interrogators of the British Prosecution, who asked me
about the subject, and I replied that that was about one-third of the
amount which was spent on rearmament. After that, without the
Reichsbank, beginning with 1 April 1938, the figure stated in that
budget year for rearmament was 11,000,000,000, and in the subsequent
year, 20,500,000,000, and of that not a pfennig came from the
Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That was after your resignation, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That was after I had stopped credits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the record I should like to say that I think I made a mistake
before. I said millions instead of milliards, but I think it is obvious
what I meant. I wanted only to correct it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, then, Dr. Schacht, the Prosecution have stated that
on 19 February 1935 the Ministry of Finance received authority to
borrow unlimited amounts of money if Hitler ordered them to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Here, again, the prosecutor did not see things in the
proper light. The President of the Reichsbank is not responsible for
the actions of the Reich Minister of Finance. I think the President
of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York can hardly be held
responsible for the things done by the Secretary of the Treasury in
Washington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You have also been accused that the debt of the Reich
increased three times during the time while you were President of
the Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I might just as well be accused of being responsible
for the fact that the birth rate in Germany rose sharply during the
time I was President of the Reichsbank. I want to emphasize the
fact that I had nothing to do with either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You were not responsible for the same reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, of course I am not responsible for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And presumably the same applies to the point made
by the Prosecution that you allegedly drafted a new finance program
in 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: On the contrary, I refused to do anything else for
the financing of rearmament; the finance program was drafted by a
state secretary in the Reich Finance Ministry, and it looked like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One of your economic policies, during the time you
were Minister of Economy, and which you have been accused of as
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>
being a preparation for war, was the so-called “New Plan” (Neue
Plan). What was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I first of all say that the New Plan had
nothing at all to do with rearmament. Germany, after the Treaty
of Versailles, had fallen into a state of distress, economically speaking
and especially export...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Your Lordship, if the Tribunal is of the opinion that
the New Plan has nothing to do with the rearmament and preparations
for war—I think the Prosecution are of the opposite opinion—then,
of course, the question is irrelevant, and I will drop it. I am
only putting it because the New Plan has been used in the argumentation
of the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you say, and the defendant has just said
that the New Plan had nothing to do with rearmament, I think you
might leave it for cross-examination and you can raise it again in
re-examination if it is cross-examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant</span>]: In that case I shall not ask
you about the barter agreements, either. I shall leave it to the
Prosecution to bring it out during the cross-examination. I cannot
see what it has to do with the preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, you have already stated that you strove to remove the Versailles
Treaty by means of peaceful negotiations, or at least, to
modify it. In the opinion which you held at that time did any such
means for a peaceful modification of the Versailles Treaty still exist?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In my opinion, there were no means other than
peaceful ones. The desire to modify the Versailles Treaty by means
of a new war was a crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well. But now you are being accused that the alleged
preparations for war, which really were a countermeasure to the
general rearmament although not a preparation for an aggressive
war, were nevertheless a rearmament, and as such, were an infringement
of the Treaty of Versailles. I assume that you, at the time,
decided to help finance that rearmament only after giving the problem
due legal and moral considerations. What, exactly, were these
considerations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think I have already answered that question in
detail. I need add nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well. Insofar as you know, was this attitude of
yours, the attitude of a pacifist and of someone who was definitely
opposed to the extension of living space in Europe, known abroad?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As long as I have been President of the Reichsbank,
that is to say from March 1933—and I am, of course, only talking
<span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span>
about the Hitler regime—my friends and acquaintances abroad were
fully informed about my attitude and views. I had a great many
friends and acquaintances abroad, not only because of my profession
but also outside of that and particularly in Basel, Switzerland, where
we had our monthly meeting at the International Bank, with all the
presidents of the issuing banks of all the great and certain neutral
countries, and I always took occasion at all these meetings to describe
quite clearly the situation in Germany to these gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps I may at this point refer to the so-called conducting of
foreign conferences or conversations. If one is not allowed to talk
to foreigners any more, then one cannot, of course, reach an understanding
with them. Those silly admonitions, that one had to avoid
contact with foreigners, seem entirely uncalled for to me, and if the
witness Gisevius deemed it necessary the other day to protect his
dead comrades, who were my comrades too, from being accused of
committing high treason, then I should like to say that I consider
it quite unnecessary. Never at any time did any member of our
group betray any German interests. To the contrary, he fought for
the interests of Germany, and to prove that, I should like to give
you a good example:</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we had occupied Paris, the files of the Quai d’Orsay were
confiscated and were carefully screened by officials from the German
Foreign Office. I need not assure you that they were primarily
looking for proof whether there were not any so-called defeatists
circles in Germany which had unmasked themselves somewhere
abroad. All the files of the Quai d’Orsay referring to my person
and, of course, there were records of many discussions which I had
had with Frenchmen, were examined by the Foreign Office officials
at that time, without my knowing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day—I think it probably happened in the course of 1941—I
received a letter from a German professor who had participated in
this search carried out by the Foreign Office. I shall mention the
name so that, if necessary, he can testify. He is a Professor of
Finance and National Economy, Professor Stückenbeck of Erlangen,
and he wrote me that at this investigation...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal cannot see any point in this, so
far as this Trial is concerned. In any event, if the defendant says
that he did not, in any way, give away the interests of Germany,
surely that is sufficient. We do not need all the details about it.
What it has got to do with this Trial, I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I think, Your Lordship, that that was not the point of
the statement. What he wants to say is that reliable men abroad
knew him and were acquainted with the fact that he was certainly
a man of peace and not a man who prepared aggressive wars, and
that applies even to the period of rearmament.
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But he said that 5 minutes ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I do not think the question of Professor Stückenbeck
is so important, but it certainly seems pertinent to me what Ambassador
Davies said about his conversation with the then Foreign
Commissar of the Soviet Republic, Litvinov. This is contained in
Exhibit Schacht-18 of my document book. It is Page 43 of the German
text, and Page 49 of the English text. May I read one paragraph,
and then ask Dr. Schacht briefly whether that statement of
Ambassador Davies corresponds to his recollection? It is Davies’
report, an extract from his book <span class='it'>Mission to Moscow</span>. A report is
there to the Secretary of State in the United States. The passage is
on Pages 108 and 109.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Pursuant to an appointment made, I called upon Commissar
for Foreign Affairs Litvinov to present my respects before
departure for the United States.</p>

<p>“I then stated that the European situation in its elementals
looked simple and that it was difficult to understand why the
statesmanship of Europe could not provide that England,
France, Germany, Italy, and Russia should agree to preserve
the territorial integrity of Europe and through trade agreements
provide Germany with raw materials, thereby giving
the assurance that she could live, which would relieve the
peoples of Europe and the world of these terrific burdens of
armament and of the fear of catastrophic war. The prompt
rejoinder was: ‘Do you think Hitler would ever agree to anything
like that?’ I said that I did not know, but that it was
my opinion that there was a very substantial body of influential
and responsible men in Germany that such an idea would
appeal to. Litvinov replied that he thought that might be so;
that Schacht was of that type; he did not think they could
prevail against Hitler and the political and military forces
dominant in Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And now I ask you, do you remember that conversation with
Davies?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think there must be a mistake. I did not speak to
Davies about this, I spoke to Litvinov. This is a report of Davies
to the Secretary of State, about which I did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, you are perfectly right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been repeatedly emphasized by the Prosecution that your
knowledge of Hitler’s intentions of war resulted also from your
being Plenipotentiary for War Economy and a member of the Reich
Defense Counsel. Göring has made a detailed statement on it. Have
you anything new to add to Göring’s statement?
<span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think the witness Lammers has also talked about
it. I should like merely to confirm that the first Reich Defense
Counsel of 1935 was nothing other than the legalization of a committee
which existed before 1933, made up of ministerial officials
who were supposed to deal with economic measures as well as
administrative measures, which might have to be taken in the event
of a threat of war against Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How often did you have a meeting especially with the
Minister of War and the Plenipotentiary for Administration?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: This famous triumvirate, this Three Man College
described by one of the prosecutors as the cornerstone of war policy,
never met at all, and it is no wonder that we lost the war, if that
was the cornerstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution have also referred to the report of the
Ministry of War regarding the task of the Reich Defense Counsel of
1934. It is Document Number EC-128, Exhibit Number USA-623.
Have you anything in particular to add to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I should like to have permission to quote one
very brief paragraph. I see there are only two sentences. This
report contains the following statement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Referring to the experiences of World War I, that is 1914 to 1918,
and I quote—I shall have to do it in English since I have only the
English, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At that time we were able to extend our bases for raw
materials and production toward the West: Longwy, Briey,
Tourcoing, Roubaix, Antwerp (textiles), and toward the East,
Lodz, and Southeast (ore mines in Serbia and Turkey, mineral
oils in Romania). Today we have to reckon with the possibility
of being thrown back in our own country and even of
being deprived thereby of most valuable industrial and raw
material in the West and in the East.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I think that if anyone wanting to prepare an aggressive war had
calculated in September 1934 that one would have to protect oneself
against the possibility of such a situation arising, that this is the best
proof that there can be no question of an aggressive war at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In that connection, under the heading of “peaceful
efforts,” can you perhaps also tell the Tribunal what your peaceful
efforts were, to have the reparations clauses of the Versailles Treaty
modified or even abolished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: From the very first moment, after the reparations
were determined in 1921 or so, I fought against this nonsense with
the argument that the carrying out of those reparations would throw
the entire world into economic chaos. One cannot, during one
<span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span>
generation, pay 120,000,000,000 Reichsmark or about 2,000,000,000
Reichsmark yearly, as at that time...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We would like to make it brief. Will you please talk
only about your peaceful efforts and not about national economy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: All right, I will not talk about national economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I fought against it and, as time went by, I did succeed in convincing
the people of almost all the countries that this was sheer
nonsense. Therefore in July of 1932, if I am not mistaken, the then
Reich Chancellor Papen was in a position to affix his signature to
an agreement at Lausanne, which reduced reparations, <span class='it'>de jure</span>, to
a pending sum of 3,000,000,000, and which, <span class='it'>de facto</span>, canceled reparations
altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you then continue your definitely peaceful efforts
in other fields? You have already touched upon the negotiations in
Paris regarding the colonial question. I wonder if you have anything
to add to that in this connection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not remember at the moment how far I had
gone at the time, but I think I reported on the negotiations in detail,
so I need not repeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: George Messersmith, the often-mentioned former Consul
General of the United States in Berlin, states in his affidavit
Document Number EC-451, Exhibit Number USA-626, to which the
Prosecution have referred, that he is of the opinion that the National
Socialist regime could not have been in a position to stay in power
and build up its war machine if it had not been for your activity.
At the end of the case for the Prosecution, the Prosecution present
that thesis of Messersmith. Therefore I should like you to make a
statement on this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know whether that completely unsubstantiated
private opinion of Mr. Messersmith has any value as evidence.
Nevertheless, I should like to contradict it by means of a few figures.
I had stated earlier that until 31 March 1938, the Reichsbank had
given 12,000,000,000; that is to say, during the first fiscal year, about
2,250,000,000, and during the subsequent 3 years, 3,250,000,000 per
annum. During those years—the Codefendant Keitel was asked
about that when he was examined here—the armament expenditures,
as Keitel said, amounted to the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fiscal year 1935-1936—5,000,000,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fiscal year 1936-1937—7,000,000,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following fiscal year—9,000,000,000.</p>

<p class='noindent'>And at that stage the assistance from the Reichsbank ceased. In
spite of that, during the following year and without any assistance
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span>
from the Reichsbank, the expenditure for armament increased to
11,000,000,000, and in the following year it climbed to 20,500,000,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears, therefore, that even without the financial genius of
Herr Schacht, they managed to raise the funds. Just how they did
so is another question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I duly put these figures to the Defendant Keitel. I do
not think that the Tribunal had the document at the time. It is now
available and has the Exhibit Number Schacht-7. It is Page 15 of
the German text and Page 21 of the English text. Herr Keitel could,
of course, only refer to the first column, that is to say, total expenditure;
but there is a second and a third column, in this account,
and these two are calculations made by Schacht, calculations regarding
what was raised with the help and without the help of the
Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not intend to go through it in detail now. I should merely
like to have your permission to ask Dr. Schacht whether the figures
calculated by him, in Columns 2 and 3 of the document, were calculated
correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have these figures in the document before me. The
figures are absolutely correct and again I want to declare that they
show that, during the first year after the Reichsbank had discontinued
its assistance, no less than 5,125,000,000 more were spent
without the assistance of the Reichsbank, that is to say, a total of
11,000,000,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Up to now you have stated to the Tribunal that you
were active against a dangerous and extensive rearmament and you
showed that by tying up the money bag. Did you oppose excessive
rearmament in any other way, for instance, by giving lectures
and such?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Many times I spoke not only before economists and
professors who were my main auditors, but I often spoke upon invitation
of the Minister of War and the head of the Army Academy
before high-ranking officers. In all these lectures I continually
referred to the financial and economic limitations to which German
rearmament was subject and I warned against excessive rearmament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When did you first gather the impression that the
extent of German rearmament was excessive and exaggerated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It is very difficult to give you a date. Beginning
in 1935, I made continuous attempts to slow down the speed of
rearmament. On one occasion Hitler had said—just a moment, I
have it here—that until the spring of 1936 the same speed would
have to be maintained. I adhered to that as much as possible,
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>
although, beginning with the second half of 1935, I continuously
applied the brake. But after 1935 I told myself that, since the
Führer himself had said it, after the spring of 1936 the same speed
would no longer be necessary. This can be seen from Document
1301-PS in which these statements of mine are quoted, statements
which I communicated to the so-called “small Ministerial Council”
(kleiner Ministerrat). Göring contradicted me during that meeting,
but I of course maintain the things which I said at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that I constantly tried to make the Minister of War do
something to slow down the speed of rearmament, if only in the
interest of general economy, since I wanted to see the economic
system working for the export trade. Proof for the fact of just
how much I urged the Minister of War is contained in my letter
dated 24 December 1935, which I wrote him when I saw the period
desired by Hitler coming to an end, and when I was already applying
the brake. It has also been presented by the Prosecution as
Document Number EC-293. In the English version of the document
it is on Page 25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I beg to be allowed to quote very briefly—all my quotations
are very brief—from that document. I wrote a letter to the Reich
Minister of War, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I gather from your letter dated 29 November”—and then
come the reference numbers—“that increased demands by the
Armed Forces for copper and lead are to be expected, which
will amount to practically double the present consumption.
These are only current demands, whereas the equally urgent
provisions for the future are not contained in the figures.
You are expecting me to obtain the necessary foreign currency
for these demands, and to that I respectfully reply that
under the existing circumstances I see no possibility of
doing so.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, Blomberg is asking that I should buy raw
materials with foreign currency, and I am stating quite clearly
that I do not see any possibility of doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document goes on to say—and this is the sentence regarding
the limit up to 1 April. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In all the conferences held with the Führer and Reich
Chancellor up to now, as well as with the leading military
departments, I have expressed my conviction that it would
be possible to supply the necessary foreign currencies and
raw materials for the existing degree of rearmament until
1 April 1936. Despite the fact that, due to our cultural and
agrarian policies which are being repudiated all over the
world, this has been made extremely difficult for me and
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span>
continues to be difficult, I still hope that my original plan
may be carried out.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is to say, that I thought this proposed program could
be carried out up to 1 April, but not over and beyond that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is a fact that Minister of Transportation, Dorpmüller,
was trying to raise credits for railway purposes. What
was your attitude as President of the Reichsbank towards this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: During a conference between the Führer, Dorpmüller,
and myself, at which the Führer strongly supported Dorpmüller’s
demands, I turned that credit down straightway, and he
did not get it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The meeting of 27 May 1936 of the so-called “small
Ministerial Council,” presided over by Göring, has been discussed
here. The Prosecution contend that intentions of aggressive war
became apparent from that meeting. Did you have any knowledge
of that meeting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: What was the date, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: 27 May 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. I was present during that conference and I
see nothing in the entire document pointing to an aggressive war.
I have studied the document very carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It has furthermore been stated against you what is
contained in the report of Ambassador Bullitt, Document Number
L-151, Exhibit USA-70, dated 23 November 1937. You have heard,
of course, that the Prosecution are also drawing the conclusion
from that report that there were aggressive intentions on Hitler’s
part. Will you please make a statement about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I see nothing in the entire report to the effect
that Hitler was about to start an aggressive war. I was simply
talking about Hitler’s intentions to bring about an Anschluss of
Austria, if possible, and to give the Sudeten Germans autonomy
if possible. Neither of those two actions would be aggressive war,
and apart from that, Mr. Bullitt says the following with reference
to me in his report about this conversation. I quote: “Schacht then
went on to speak of the absolute necessity for doing something
to produce peace in Europe....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The memorandum of this conversation is also contained
in my document book as Exhibit Number Schacht-22. It
is on Page 64 of the English text and Page 57 of the German text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall now have to deal in greater detail with your alleged
knowledge of Hitler’s intentions to start war. First of all, speaking
generally, did Hitler ever, as far as you know...
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I asked Dr. Dix if
he would object if the Tribunal would allow me, since he is passing
to a new point, to mention the question of the Raeder documents.
I had a discussion with Dr. Siemers. There are still some
outstanding points, and we should be grateful if the Tribunal would
hear us this afternoon, if possible, because the translating division
is waiting for the Raeder documents to get on with their translations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How long do you think it will take, Sir
David?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Not more than a half hour,
My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If the translation department are waiting,
perhaps we had better do it at 2 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship pleases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If it is only going to take a half hour. It
isn’t likely, I suppose, to take more than that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I don’t think it will take more
than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will do that at 2 o’clock, and now we
will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: May it please Your Lordship,
the Tribunal should have in front of them a statement of our
objections to certain of the documents, arranged in six groups.
Attached to that sheet they will find an English summary of the
documents, presenting shortly the contents of each one of them.
My Lord, with regard to the first group, might I make two erasures
from our objection to Number 19, which has been allowed in the
case of Schacht, and if I understand Dr. Siemers correctly he doesn’t
press for Number 76.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, My Lord, the others in that group:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 9 is a series of quotations from Lersner’s book on
<span class='it'>Versailles</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 10, the quotation from a book by the German left-wing
publicist, Thomas Mann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 17 is the <span class='it'>Failure of a Mission</span>, by Nevile Henderson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 45 is a quotation from a book of Mr. Churchill’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 47 is the report on a complaint to Lord Halifax about
an article in <span class='it'>News Chronicle</span> criticizing Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Number 66 is rather different. If the Tribunal would
be good enough to look at it, it is a report by a German lawyer,
Dr. Mosier I think his name should be, who is an authority on
international law, dealing with the Norway action. Dr. Siemers has
been, of course, absolutely frank with me and he said that it would
be convenient to him to have this, which is really a legal argument,
embodied in his document book. Of course, that is not really the
purpose of these document books; but, of course, it is a matter for
the Tribunal, and we felt we had to draw attention to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, My Lord, Number 76 comes out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 93 to 96 are quotations from Soviet newspapers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 101 is a quotation from Havas, the French News Agency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 102 to 107 are minor orders relating to the Low Countries
which, the Prosecution submit, have no evidential value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in the second group, there are a number of documents
which, the Prosecution submit, are not relevant to any of the issues
in the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, you didn’t deal with Number 109,
did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am sorry, My Lord, it is on
the second line. That is another legal argument, the effect of the
war on the legal position of Iceland, which is a quotation from the
<span class='it'>British Journal of Information in Public Law and International La</span>w.
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: All right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, the second group, the
Prosecution submit, is irrelevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 22 is a Belgian decree of 1937 dealing with the possible
evacuation of the civil population in time of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 39 is a French document of the Middle East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 63 and 64 are two speeches, one by Mr. Emery and
another by Mr. Churchill, dealing with the position in Greece at
the end of 1940, some two months after the beginning of the Italian
campaign against Greece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 71 is an undated directive with regard to the study of
routes in Belgium, which doesn’t seem to us to have any evidential
importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 76 comes out as the <span class='it'>Altmark</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you say 76 came out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, that is the
<span class='it'>Altmark</span>. It is the same one that is in Number 71. I am sorry,
My Lord, it should have been marked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 99 is the minutes of the ninth meeting of the combined
Cabinet Council on the 27th of April 1940, and it deals with a
suggestion of M. Reynaud with regard to the Swedish ore mines.
As it was long after the Norway campaign and it was never, of
course, acted upon in Norway, it seems to us to have no relevance
for this Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 102 to 107 I have dealt with under one. They have
certain very small unimportant memoranda relating to the Low
Countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 112 is a French document in which Paul Reynaud quotes
a statement from Mr. Churchill that he will fight on to the end,
which again doesn’t seem of much importance in 1946.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, My Lord, the next group are documents which were rejected
by the Tribunal when applied for by the Defendant Ribbentrop.
The first two deal with British rearmament and the others
with the Balkans and Greece. The Tribunal will probably remember
the group which they did reject in the Ribbentrop application; and
the fourth group are other documents of the same series as those
rejected by the Tribunal in the case of the Defendant Von Ribbentrop.
The fifth group are really objectionable on the <span class='it'>tu quoque</span>
basis. I think they are entirely French documents which deal with
proposals in a very tentative stage and which were arranged, but
never followed out, with regard to the destruction of oil fields or
the blocking of the Danube in the Middle East. My Lord, they are
documents dated in the spring of 1940 and, as I say, they deal with
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span>
the most tentative stages and were never put into operation. The
plans were never in operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sixth group are documents dealing with Norway, which were
captured after the occupation of France. As I understand
Dr. Siemers’ argument, it is not suggested that these documents
were within the knowledge of the defendants at the time that they
carried out the aggression against Norway; but it is stated that they
had other information. Of course, as to their own information, we
have not made any objection at all; and that these documents might
be argued to be corroborative of their agents’ reports. Actually, as
is shown by Document Number 83, to which we make no objection,
they also deal with tentative proposals which were not put into
effect and were not proceeded with; but in the submission of the
Prosecution, the important matter must be what was within the
knowledge of the defendants before the 9th of April 1940; and it
is irrelevant to go into a large number of other documents which
are only arguably consistent with the information which the defendants
stated they had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I tried to deal with them very shortly because I made
a promise to the Tribunal on the time, but I hope that I have
indicated very clearly what our objections were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. WALTER SIEMERS (Counsel for Defendant Raeder): Your
Honors, it is extremely difficult to define my position with reference
to so many documents, especially since I know that these documents
have not yet been translated and that the contents, in the main,
are therefore not known to those concerned. Therefore, I might
point out that there is a certain danger in treating documents in
this way. In part they are basic elements of my defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I should like to state now that in dealing with these
documents I shall be compelled, in order to give the reasons for the
relevancy of this evidence, to point out those passages which I shall
not need to read separately into the record, for as soon as the document
book is ready they will be known to the Tribunal and can be
read there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall follow the order as outlined by Sir David. First of all,
the first group, Document Numbers 9 and 10. The note submitted
by Sir David to the Tribunal points out that the submission of
these documents conflicts with the ruling given by the Tribunal on
29 March. In reply I should like to point out that this opinion of
the Prosecution is an error. The ruling of the Tribunal said that no
documents might be submitted concerning the injustice of the Versailles
Treaty and the pressure arising from it. These documents
do not concern the injustice and the pressure; rather they serve to
give a few examples of the subjective attitude of a man like Noske,
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span>
who was a Social Democrat and certainly did not want to conduct
any wars of aggression. A few other statements in Numbers 9 and
10 show the thought of the Government and the ruling class at that
time in regard to defensive measures and the fear that in case of
an attack on the part of Poland, for instance, the German Armed
Forces might be too weak. These are facts pure and simple; and I
give you my express assurance that I shall not quote any sentences
which might introduce a polemic. Moreover, I need this mainly as
a basis for my final pleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 17 is a very brief excerpt from the book by Henderson,
<span class='it'>Failure of a Mission</span>, written in 1940. I believe there are no objections
to my quoting about 15 lines, if I wish to use them in my final
pleading in order to show that Henderson, who knew Germany
well, still believed in 1940 that he had to recognize certain positive
good points in the regime at that time; and I believe that the conclusion
is justified that one cannot expect that a German military
commander should be more sceptical than the British Ambassador
at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we turn to Document Number 45. It is true this document
is taken from a book by Churchill; but it deals with a fact which
I should like to prove, the fact that already many years before
World War I there existed a British Committee for Defense. In the
table of contents which Sir David has submitted, the word “Reichsverteidigungsausschuss”
is used, and I therefore conclude that this
is a mistake on the part of the Prosecution who took it to mean a
German Reich Defense Committee; that is not correct. This document
shows how it came about that the Prosecution wrongly overestimated
the importance of the German Reich Defense Committee,
as the Prosecution naturally compared it with the British Committee
for Defense, which went very much further in its activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 47 is evidence to show that when the German Embassy
pointed out that an extremely scathing article on Hitler had appeared
in the paper <span class='it'>News Chronicle</span>, Lord Halifax pointed out in
reply that it was not possible for him to exert any influence on the
newspaper. I should merely like to compare this with the fact that
the Prosecution made it appear as though Raeder had had something
to do with the regrettable article in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>:
“Churchill sank the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>.” Raeder was no more connected with
that article than Lord Halifax with the article in the <span class='it'>News Chronicle</span>
and was unfortunately even more powerless, as far as this article
was concerned, than the British Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 66 deals with the opinion given by Dr. Mosier, a
specialist on international law, an opinion on the Norway action in
very compressed form, as the Tribunal will surely admit. The
Tribunal will also concede that in my defense of the Norway action
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span>
I must speak at length about the underlying principles of international
law. The underlying principles of international law are
not an altogether simple matter. I have nothing against presenting
this myself in all necessary detail. I was merely guided by the
thought that the Tribunal have asked again and again that we save
time. I believe that we can save considerable time if this statement
of opinion is granted me, so that I shall not have to cite
numerous excerpts and authors in detail in order to show the exact
legal justification. I could then perhaps deal with the legal questions
in half an hour, whereas without this statement of opinion it
is utterly impossible for me to treat such a problem in half an hour.
If the Prosecution do not object to more time being taken up, then
I do not object if the document is denied me. I will merely have
to take the consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 76 has meanwhile been crossed out, that is, it is granted
me by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbers 93 to 96 are excerpts on statements of the official
Moscow papers, <span class='it'>Isvestia</span> and <span class='it'>Pravda</span>. These statements prove that,
at least at that time, Soviet opinion regarding the legality of the
German action in Norway coincided with the German opinion of
that time. If the Tribunal think that these very brief quotations
should not be admitted as documents, I would not be too insistent,
since at this point in the proceedings I shall in any case be compelled
to discuss it. The Tribunal will remember that at that time
Germany and Russia were friends, and Soviet opinion on a purely
legal problem should, at any rate, be considered as having a certain
significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Number 101; I beg your pardon, Sir David, but if I am
not mistaken Dr. Braun said an hour and a half ago that Number
101 is to be rejected. Very well, then, Numbers 101 to 107. The
action against Norway, as I have already said, involved a problem
of international law. It involves the problem of whether one
country may violate the neutrality of another country when it
can be proved that another belligerent nation likewise intends to
violate the neutrality of the afore-mentioned neutral state. When
presenting my evidence I shall show that Grossadmiral Raeder, in
the autumn of 1939, received all sorts of reports to the effect that
the Allies were planning to take under their own protection the
territorial waters of Norway, that is, to land in Norway, in order
to have Norwegian bases. When I deal with the Norway documents,
I shall return to this point. I should like to say at this point that
it is necessary to explain and to prove that the legal attitude taken
by the Allies to the question of the possible violation of the neutrality
of a country was in the years 1939 and 1940 entirely the same as
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>
the attitude of the Defendant Raeder in the case of Norway at the
same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore it is necessary not only to deal with Norway; but also
to show that this was a basic conception, which can readily be
proved by reference to parallel cases on the strength of these documents.
These parallel cases deal in the first place with the plans
of the Allies with respect to the Balkans, and secondly with the
plans of the Allies with respect to the Caucasian oil fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors, it is by no means my intention, as Sir David has
suggested, to use these documents from the <span class='it'>tu quoque</span> point of view,
from the point of view that the defendant has done something,
which the Allies have also done or wanted to do. I am concerned
only with a judgment of the Defendant Raeder’s actions from the
legal point of view. One can understand such actions only when
the entire matter is brought to light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is my opinion—and in addition to this I should like to refer
to the statement of Dr. Mosier’s opinion, Exhibit Raeder-66—that
this cannot be made the subject of an accusation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are concerned, Your Honors, with the right of self-preservation
as recognized in principle by international law. In this connection
I should like...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, we don’t want to go into these
matters in great detail, you know, at this stage. If you state what
your reasons are in support and state them shortly, we shall be able
to consider the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I am very sorry that I have to go into these
details, but if through the objection of the Prosecution the principles...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal do not wish to hear you in
detail. I have said that the Tribunal do not wish to hear you in
detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I merely ask that the Tribunal take into consideration
the fact that this concerns the principle of international
law laid down by Kellogg himself in 1928, namely, the right of
self-preservation, or “the right of self-defense.” For that reason
1 should like to adduce these documents showing that just as the
Allies acted quite correctly according to this principle, so also did
the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number 22 is next. I have given various statements
of principle which apply to a large number of the remaining documents,
so that I can refer to the statements I have already made.
These statements also apply to Documents Numbers 22 and 39.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as Documents Numbers 63 and 64 are concerned, I should
like to point out that these documents deal with Greece; and not
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>
only these two, but also a later group of perhaps 10 or 12 documents,
with which I should like to deal very briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as Greece is concerned, the situation is as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must admit that I was more than surprised that the Prosecution
objected to these documents, about 14 in all. In Document Number
C-12, Exhibit Number GB-226, the Prosecution accuse Raeder of
having decreed on 30 December 1939; and I quote, “Greek merchantmen
in the prohibited area declared by the United States and
England are to be treated as enemy ships.” The accusation would
be justified, if Greece had not behaved in such a manner that
Raeder had to resort to this order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the documents concerning Greece which show that Greece
did not strictly keep to her neutrality are struck out, then I cannot
bring any counterevidence. I do not believe that it is the intention
of the Prosecution to restrict my presentation of evidence in this
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are all documents which date back to this time and which
show that Greece put her merchantmen at the disposal of England
who was at war with Germany. Therefore they could be treated
as enemy ships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I would like to say that I
should have told the Tribunal I would make no objection to Documents
Numbers 53 and 54, because they do deal with the chartering
of Greek steamers by the British Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But you made no objection to them; you
didn’t object to Numbers 53 or 54.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I wanted to make clear that I
don’t object to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is no objection on the paper. What
you are dealing with, Dr. Siemers, is 63 and 64, not 53 and 54?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, I beg your pardon, I see it further on. Yes, I see; will you
please strike that out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: There is no objection to Numbers 53 and 54?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, no objection. My Lord, my
friend was dealing with the Greek fleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes; I beg your pardon, I misheard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: The same things, as I have already stated regarding
Documents Numbers 101 to 107, apply also to Document
Number 71.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 99 belongs really to Group 6, to the Norwegian documents;
and I should like to refer to these collectively and then refer
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span>
again later to Number 99. All these documents concern Norway,
that is, the planning by the Allies with respect to Norway. These
documents deal positively with the planning of the landing in
Narvik, the landing in Stavanger, the landing in Bergen, and the
absolute necessity of having Norwegian bases. The documents
mention that Germany should not be allowed to continue getting
ore supplies from Sweden. They also deal in some measure with
Finland. There are likewise documents which support the same
plan after the Finnish-Russian war had already been concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to quote from these documents to prove their
relevancy. Since the Tribunal has told me that I cannot do that,
I ask that these brief references be considered sufficient. The facts
contained in these documents agree, point for point, with those
reports which Grossadmiral Raeder received from September 1939
until March 1940 from the Intelligence Service of the German
Wehrmacht headed by Admiral Canaris. These plans agree with the
information which Raeder received during the same 6 months
through the Naval Attaché in Oslo, Korvettenkapitän Schreiber,
and with the information which he received in a letter from
Admiral Carls at the end of September 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The information from these three sources caused the Defendant
Raeder to point out the great danger involved were Norway to fall
into the hands of the Allies, which would mean that Germany had
lost the war. It is, therefore, a purely strategic consideration. The
occupation of Norway did not, as contended by the British Prosecution,
have anything to do with the prestige or desire for conquest
but was concerned solely with these positive pieces of information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must therefore prove, first of all, that the Defendant Raeder
did receive this information and, secondly, that these reports were
objective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, you are dealing with Document
Number 99, are you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Yes, 99, and all of Group 6.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know what you mean by Group 6;
99 is in Group B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: The group under the letter “F,” which Sir David
called Group 6, the last on the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The objection of the Prosecution to that
document was that it was a document of the 27th of April 1940, at
a time after Germany had invaded Norway. You haven’t said
anything about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I wanted to avoid dealing with each document
singly, because I believe that these can be treated generally.
However, in this specific case...
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t want you to deal with each document
separately. I thought you were dealing with Document
Number 99. If you can deal with them in groups, by all means do
so. However, you are taking up a great deal of the Tribunal’s time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: This Document Number 99 is the Minutes of the
Ninth Meeting of the Supreme Council, that is, the military operational
staff of England and France, on 27 April. The heading shows beyond
doubt that it was after the occupation of Norway. However, that
is only a formal objection. The contents of the document show
that at this session the participants discussed the happenings
during the period before the occupation, and the most important
leaders of the Allies took part in this meeting. Chamberlain,
Halifax, Churchill, Sir Samuel Hoare, Sir Alexander Cadogan,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span> and, on the French side Reynaud, Daladier, Gamelin, and
Darlan were present; and these gentlemen discussed the previous
plans which, I admit, had misfired because of the German occupation
of Norway. But they did discuss about how necessary it
was that the iron-ore deposits in Sweden should fall into the hands
of the Allies and what was to be done now to prevent Germany’s
getting this ore and how the destruction of these iron-ore deposits
could be brought about. I believe, therefore, that though this
happened at a later date, the train of thought I have presented is
of significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we turn to Document Number 100. This deals with the
session of the French War Committee of 9 April 1940, which concerns
the same problem: what the Allies had planned and what
could be planned now that the report had just come in about the
action on the part of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Documents Numbers 102 to 107 have already been dealt with.
For Document Number 110 the same statements apply as for Documents
101 to 107.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document Number 112 is a document which shows that Churchill,
as early as May 1940, expected active intervention on the part of
America. I wanted to present this in connection with the accusation
raised against the Defendant Raeder, that in the spring of 1941 he
was instrumental in bringing about a war against the United States
by way of Japan. For me this document is not nearly so important
as those basic documents which I have referred to at greater length.
Therefore, I leave this completely to the discretion of the Prosecution
or the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next group consists of documents which were turned down
in the case of Ribbentrop. I should like to point out that I did not
have the opportunity in the Ribbentrop case to define my position
as to the justification and relevancy of these documents. Therefore
<span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span>
I consider it insufficient simply to state that these documents were
refused in the case of Ribbentrop, that the charges against Ribbentrop...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have already carefully considered the
arguments and have decided those documents were inadmissible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I believed that the decision applied only to the
Ribbentrop case, since no other point of view was discussed during
those proceedings, namely, that of the charges raised against
Raeder in which connection it is expressly said in Document C-152
that Raeder brought about the occupation of the whole of Greece.
That is an accusation that was not made against Ribbentrop but
only against Raeder. How can I refute this accusation if these
documents are denied me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, the Tribunal know the documents
and know the charges against Raeder, and they don’t desire
to hear any further argument on it. They will consider the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I beg the pardon of the Tribunal. Under these
circumstances I am compelled to see whether all these documents
were covered in Ribbentrop’s case. My notes, as I told the Prosecution
this morning, do not agree with the statements of the Prosecution.
Perhaps after the session, if I am unable to do so at the
moment, I might point out whether or not the documents are
identical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is really a fact that in Ribbentrop’s case these documents were
not presented in their entirety and that the Tribunal therefore does
not know them in their entirety. Whether Dr. Horn had marked
exactly the same passages as I wish to use, I am not able to say
as far as each individual document is concerned. I know only that
in the large majority of cases Dr. Horn did not present the entire
document because he was presenting it only from the point of view
of the Ribbentrop case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Presumably you have submitted your extracts
to the Prosecution. The Prosecution tell us that those extracts
are the same ones that were rejected in Ribbentrop’s case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, we have only a list
of those documents so far. We haven’t seen the extracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was a pause in the proceedings while the Prosecution
conferred.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I am sorry. I spoke too quickly. We have seen the
extracts in German and we haven’t had them translated. We have
done the best we could in German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: 24 and 25, at any rate, are both speeches in
English.
<span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, some of them
are. I am sorry, My Lord; these are. Your Lordship is quite right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, as I understand it, Dr. Siemers
says that these are not the same passages of evidence, or suggested
evidence, as were rejected in Ribbentrop’s case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I did not do the
actual checking myself, but Major Barrington, who checked the
Ribbentrop documents, went through these and compared the two,
and he gave me that which forms the basis of our note. That is the
position. I can’t tell Your Lordship that I have actually checked
these myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Siemers is telling us that that is
untrue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: As I understood Dr. Siemers,
he was saying that he didn’t know whether they were the same
extracts...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: May I just make one remark in connection with
that, please? I am not quite certain that I can say in each specific
case which extracts were contained in the Ribbentrop case, but
they are not the same. I know for certain that they are not the
same because in order to relieve the work of the Translation
Division I compared the numbers and in the few cases in which
they were the same I told the Translation Division that these documents
were identical so that they would not be translated a second
time. But I am sorry to say that a large number of the documents
were not the same, as they were asked for by Dr. Horn and
Ribbentrop from a completely different point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might also point out that the numbers under Group D which
are enumerated here as Ribbentrop Documents Numbers 29, 51, 56,
57, 60, 61, 62, although I made every effort to find them, could not
be found in the Ribbentrop Document Book. And the list does not
show which numbers they should be in the Ribbentrop Document
Book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, that is not suggested.
What is said is that they are in the same series which deals with
the same subject—that is, the question of Greece and the Balkans—as
those documents which the Tribunal ruled out in the case of
Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Siemers, I think the best course
would be for you to go through these documents this afternoon
under the heading “C” and find out whether they are the same
ones rejected in Ribbentrop’s case; and if they are not, indicate
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span>
exactly in what they differ from the documents rejected in Ribbentrop’s
case, so as to show they have some relevance to your case;
and we shall expect to have that by 5 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now will you go on with the others?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: May I perhaps make one remark about what
Sir David said regarding group “D”? They were not objected to
because they have already been mentioned in Ribbentrop’s case;
but only because they deal with the same subject matter, that is
true. The same subject matter, namely, Greece, is dealt with; and
I can only reply that the Prosecution have charged the Defendant
Raeder in Document C-152 with having aimed at, and brought
about, the occupation of the whole of Greece. The facts concerning
this statement of three lines I can present only if I am allowed
some documents referring to Greece and only if these are not
refused on the grounds that the documents concerning Greece were
turned down quite generally in Ribbentrop’s case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I come to group “E” which begins with Document 26. The
same statements apply which I have already set forth in regard
to Documents Numbers 101 to 107. The attacks planned by the
Allies on the oil regions in neutral Romania and in the neutral
Caucasus—as I should like to remark in parenthesis—have already
been dealt with in these proceedings. The Tribunal will remember
that I asked Göring during his examination about entries in Jodl’s
diary pertaining to this question and he has given information
about the reports received by Germany, on Pages 6031 and 6033
of the transcript of 18 March (Volume IX, Pages 402-404). This testimony
too concerns only the subjective side, that is, what was
known by Germany. I must prove that the objective side, the fact
that this had actually been planned, agrees exactly with the subjective
side, that is, with these reports. These documents, Numbers
26, 30 to 32, 36, 37, 39, 40 to 44, are to prove that. Then
comes Number 99 which has already been dealt with, which seems
to be here in duplicate; Number 101, and Number 110 which also
seem to be duplicates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turn now to Group 6, which is supposed to be irrelevant,
dealing with the attack on Norway. I have already, on principle,
set forth my reasons and I beg the Tribunal not to deny me these
documents under any circumstances. If I am not granted these documents,
I shall simply not be in a position to present evidence in a
reasonable manner without telling everything myself. I can present
proof in regard to a question of such importance only if documents
are granted me just as they are granted the Prosecution.
But if all the documents, practically all the documents concerning
this question are refused, then I do not know how I am to treat
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span>
such a question. And I believe that the Tribunal will wish to assist
me in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am requesting this especially for the following reasons: When
I gave my reasons for wanting to present this particular evidence,
I asked that those files of the British Admiralty be brought in, which
dealt with the preparations and planning regarding Scandinavia,
that is, Norway. Sir David did not object at that time but said he
would have to consult the British Admiralty. The Tribunal decided
accordingly and granted my application. In the meantime the
British Admiralty has answered, and I assume that Sir David will
agree to my reading the answer which has been put at my disposal.
This answer is as follows—it concerns, if I may say that in advance...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have had the answer, I think, have we
not? We have had the answer and transmitted it to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Thank you very much. From this reply it can
be seen that the files will not be submitted, that I cannot get the
necessary approval. It can also be seen that certain facts which
will be important for my presentation of evidence will be admitted
by the British Admiralty; but in reality I am not in a position to
prove anything by means of documents. Since I am unable to make
use of this evidence, I ask at least to be allowed the other means
of presenting evidence, that is, the documents contained in the
German White Books. These are documents recognized as being
correct. In all cases they are facsimiles. They can be carefully
examined and I believe...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, we are dealing with your
application for particular documents. We are not dealing with any
general argument or general criticism that you have to make. We
are only hearing you in answer to certain objections on behalf of
the British Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR: SIEMERS: Your Honor, unless I am very much mistaken—in
which case you will pleas correct me—Sir David, with a few exceptions,
defined his position regarding these documents under “F”—this
is a large number, from 59 to 91 with some omissions—as a
whole and not his position regarding each individual document. But
I have to say the same thing to practically each document and
asked only that I be granted those documents as a whole, for I cannot
make headway without these documents...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You were not referring to these documents.
You were referring to the fact that the British Admiralty was not
prepared to disclose its files to you. It has nothing to do with these
documents at all.
<span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I believe I have been misunderstood, Your
Honors. I have already stated very clearly why I need these documents
for my presentation of evidence regarding the Norway
action. Beyond that I said merely that if these documents are not
granted me, then I cannot present any evidence. I am deprived of
it. I asked the Tribunal merely to take into consideration the fact
that the documents from London, which I had originally counted
on, are not at my disposal. And I do not know why this request,
which I am submitting to the Tribunal and which is only in explanation
of my previous statements, is being taken amiss by the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that all you have to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I have now finished, Your Honors. It is not at
all my intention to read all these documents or to spend too much
time on them. I believe that if I am granted these documents, the
presentation of evidence will be much easier, for these are groups
of documents which show the chronological development of certain
plans; and if I have the 5th, 6th or 7th document, then I need not
read each one. But if I am granted just one document, I will be
put in an extremely difficult position and will have to speak in
greater detail than I would if I could simply refer to these documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will consider it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Dr. Dix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now, we come to the
whole question of your alleged knowledge of the direct war objectives
of Hitler. You have already mentioned in a general way
that Hitler never spoke about war to you. Have you anything to
add to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You also touched upon the question of the sincerity
of his peaceful assurances and his disarmament proposals. Have
you anything to add to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, at the beginning I believed that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And did the various members of the Cabinet ever
speak to you about warlike intentions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Never did I hear anything from any of my fellow
colleagues in the Reich Cabinet which could lead me to believe that
anyone had the intention of going to war or would welcome it if
Germany were to start a war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, we turn to your own attitude towards the war.
You already indicated your general attitude when you spoke about
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>
your philosophy as a pacifist. I believe, therefore, that it is more
expedient if I read from my document book the opinion of a third
person, one who knows you very well, the former member of the
Reichsbank Directorate, Huelse. It is the Schacht Document 37-C,
Page 160 of the German text, and 168 of the English text. It is an
affidavit. And there, beginning with Paragraph 2, Huelse says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I recall several chance talks with Dr. Schacht during the
years 1935 to 1939 about war and rearmament. In these talks
he always expressed his aversion to any war and any warlike
conduct. He held the firm opinion that even to the
conqueror war brings only disadvantages and that a new
European war would, on the whole, be a crime against culture
and humanity. He hoped for a long period of peace for Germany,
as she needed it more than other countries in order
to improve and stabilize her unstable economic situation.</p>

<p>“To my knowledge, until the beginning of 1938, Dr. Schacht
at meetings of the Reichsbank Board of Directors and in
private conversations on the subject of armament always
spoke only of defense measures. I believe I can recall that
he told me in the middle of 1938 that Hitler’s provocative
action against Austria and the Sudeten country was worse
than thoughtless from the military point of view.</p>

<p>“He said that Germany had undertaken only a defensive
armament, which would prove absolutely inadequate as a
defense in case of attack by one of the big powers, a possibility
with which Hitler had to reckon. He said that he had
never heard that the Wehrmacht was in any way designed
or armed for an aggressive war.</p>

<p>“When the war did break out and spread more and more, he
said repeatedly that he had greatly erred in his judgment
of Hitler’s personality; he had hoped for a long time that
Hitler would develop into a real statesman who, after the
experience of the World War I, would avoid any war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You have already touched upon the question of an annexation
of Austria and given your general opinion. I ask you now to make
a concrete statement about the Anschluss after it had actually taken
place and especially about the manner in which this Anschluss was
carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That this Anschluss would come at some time we
Germans all knew. As for the various political negotiations which
took place between Hitler, Schuschnigg and others, I naturally was
as little informed as were the other Cabinet Ministers, with the
probable exception of Göring and Ribbentrop and perhaps one or
two more. The actual Anschluss in March was a complete surprise
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span>
to us, not the fact but the date. A great surprise and we, at any
rate my acquaintances and I myself, were completely surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How did you judge the manner, the nature and development
of this Anschluss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I believe that much can be said about the manner.
What we heard subsequently and what I have learned in these
proceedings is certainly not very gratifying, but I believe that it
would have had very little practical influence on the Anschluss
itself and the course of events. The whole thing was more of a
demonstration to the outside world, similar perhaps to the marching
into the Rhineland; but it had no great effect in my opinion on the
course of the negotiations. I am speaking now of the marching in
of the troops. This march was more or less a festive reception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution have pointed out that in March 1938
you regulated the relation of the schilling to the mark for the event
of a possible Anschluss, and by this the Prosecution obviously want
to prove that you had previous knowledge of this action. Will you
tell us your position as to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The fact to which the Prosecution refer is a communication
from a Lieutenant Colonel Wiedemann. March 11, at about
3 o’clock in the afternoon—I believe I remember that but I cannot
say whether it was by telephone or in person—someone, it may
have been Lieutenant Colonel Wiedemann, inquired of me how
the purchasing power for the troops in Austria was to be regulated
if German troops should march into Austria, purely as a matter of
currency policy, and whether it was necessary to have any regulation
prescribed. I told him that of course everything had to be
paid for, everything that the troops might buy there, and that the
rate of exchange; if they paid in schillings and not in marks, would
be 1 mark to 2 schillings. That was the rate which obtained at the
time, which remained fairly steady and was the recognized ratio
of the schilling to the mark. The fact that in the afternoon of the
11th I was approached about this matter is the best proof that I
had no previous knowledge of these matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Prosecution further consider it an accusation
against you that in your speech to the Austrian National Bank after
the marching in of the troops, you used decidedly National Socialist
phraseology and thus welcomed the Anschluss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps we can use this opportunity to save time and reply to
the accusation made repeatedly by the Prosecution that in speeches,
petitions, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, you sometimes thought fit to adopt a tone, of
which it could perhaps be said that it exuded National Socialist
ideas. That has been used as circumstantial evidence against you.
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span>
Will you please define your position to those arguments and give
your reasons for this attitude of yours?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: If I did so in the first years, I did so only in order
to remind Party circles and the people of the original program of
the National Socialist Party, to which the actual attitude of the
Party members and functionaries stood in direct contrast. I always
tried to show that the principles which I upheld in many political
matters agreed completely with the principles of the National
Socialist program as they were stated in the Party program, namely,
equal rights for all, the dignity of the individual, esteem for the
church, and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the later years I also repeatedly used National Socialist
phraseology, because from the time of my speech at Königsberg,
the contrast between my views and Hitler’s views regarding the
Party was entirely clear. And gradually within the Party I got the
reputation of being an enemy of the Party, a man whose views
were contrary to those of the Party. From that moment on not
only the possibility of my co-operation, but also my very existence
was endangered; and in such moments, when I saw my activity,
my freedom, and my life seriously threatened by the Party I utilized
these moments to show by means of an emphatically National
Socialist phraseology that I was working entirely within the framework
of the traditional policies and that my activity was in agreement
with these policies—in order to protect myself against these
attacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In other words, recalling the testimony of the witness
Gisevius about a remark of Goerdeler’s, you used Talleyrand
methods in this case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I am not entirely familiar with Talleyrand’s methods,
but at any rate I did camouflage myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In this connection I should like to read a passage from
the affidavit of Schniewind which has been quoted repeatedly. It
is Schacht Number 34. I have often indicated this page. It is
Page 118 of the German, Page 126 of the English text. Schniewind
says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“If Schacht on the other hand occasionally made statements,
oral or written, which could be construed as signifying that
he went a long way in identifying himself with the Hitler
regime, these statements were naturally known to us; but
what Schacht thought in reality was known to almost every
official in the Reichsbank and in the Reich Ministry of Economics,
above all, of course, to his closest colleagues.</p>

<p>“On many occasions we asked Dr. Schacht if he had not gone
too far in these statements. He always replied that he was
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>
under such heavy fire from the Party and the SS that he
could camouflage himself only with strong slogans and sly
statements.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I might explain that Schniewind was a high official in the Reich
Ministry of Economics, and worked directly under Schacht and
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution have also referred to an affidavit by Tilly to
the effect that you admitted that you thought Hitler capable of
aggressive intentions. Will you make a statement about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That affidavit of the British Major Tilly is entirely
correct. I told Major Tilly during the preliminary interrogation
that in 1938, during the events of the Fritsch affair and afterwards,
I had become convinced that Hitler at any rate would not avoid a
war at all costs and that possibly he even sought to bring about a
war. Looking back I pondered over a number of statements by
Hitler and asked myself the reason why Hitler, in the course of the
years, had reached the point where he might not avoid a war. And
I told Major Tilly that the only reason which I could think of was
that looking back I had the impression that Hitler had fallen into
the role which necessarily falls to each and every dictator who does
not want to relinquish his power in time, namely, that of having
to supply his people with some sort of victor’s glory—that that was
probably the development of Hitler’s thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is the same explanation as given by Prince
Metternich about Napoleon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have already remarked parenthetically that you first became
suspicious during the Fritsch affair. The witness Gisevius has described
the Fritsch affair to the Tribunal in detail. We do not wish
to repeat anything. Therefore, I am asking you only to state in
regard to the Fritsch affair anything you might have to say to
supplement or to amend Gisevius’ testimony. If that is to take a
long time—which I cannot judge—then I might suggest to the
Tribunal that we have the recess now, if the Tribunal so desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have just a brief remark to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: A brief remark. Then answer the question briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, if he can do it briefly, we had better
have it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It is just a single remark that I should like to add.
The account given by Gisevius of the development of the Fritsch
affair is, according to my knowledge and my own experience,
completely correct in every detail. I have nothing to add to that.
I can only confirm it. On the other hand, I should like to refer to a
speech of Hitler’s on 20 February 1938 in the Reichstag which
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span>
contains a remark which even at that time aroused my attention.
He said—and I quote this speech from Die Dokumente der Deutschen
Politik, of which all copies were available here:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The changes in the Reich Cabinet and in the military administration
on 4 February”—that is, changes which were
made following the Fritsch and Blomberg affair—“were for
the purpose of achieving within the shortest time that intensification
of our military means of power, which the general
conditions of the present time indicate as advisable.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This remark also confirmed my opinion that the change from a
peaceful to a military policy on Hitler’s part was becoming obvious;
I did not wish to omit reference to this remark which completes the
account given by Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: This is Exhibit Number Schacht-28 of our document
book, Page 81 of the English text, Page 74 of the German text.
There this passage is quoted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, we will adjourn now for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Several meetings have
been discussed here during which Hitler is said to have spoken
directly or indirectly about his war intentions. Did you participate
in any such meetings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, not in a single one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You disagreed, as you have stated, with Hitler and the
Party on many issues. Did you express this disagreement or did
you conform to Hitler’s instructions at all times? Can you in particular
make statements about your critical attitude, for instance, to
the Jewish question, the Church question, the Gestapo question, the
Free Mason question, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I might say in advance that Hitler never gave me
any order or any instructions which would have been in opposition
to my inner views and that I also never did anything which was
in opposition to my inner convictions. From the very beginning I
did not conceal my convictions concerning all these questions which
you have mentioned, not only when speaking to my circle of friends
and to larger Party circles, but also in addressing the public, and
even when speaking to Hitler personally. I have already stated here
that as early as the Party purge of 30 June 1934 I called Hitler’s
attention to the fact that his actions were illegal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I refer, furthermore, to a document of which unfortunately only
half has been presented by the Prosecution. It is a written report
<span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span>
which I personally submitted to Hitler on 3 May 1935. I remember
the date very well because it happened during a trial run of the
Lloyd Steamer <span class='it'>Scharnhorst</span>, at which both Hitler and I were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that day I handed him two inter-related memoranda which
together formed a unit. In the one half I made it clear that I
wanted to stop the unrestrained and constant collections of money
by various Party organizations because it seemed to me that the
money ought not to be used for Party purposes, particularly Party
installations, Party buildings, and the like, but that we urgently
needed this money for State expenses which had to be paid and
which of course included the rearmament question as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second half of this report dealt with cultural questions. The
Defense and I have tried for months to get this second half of the
document from the Prosecution, since they had submitted the first
half of the document here as evidence. It has not been possible to
obtain that second half. I must therefore confine myself to communicating
the contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to say in advance that, of course, I could only bring
forward such charges in regard to the mistaken cultural and legal
policy of the Party and of Hitler when reasons originating in my
own department gave me the excuse to submit these things to
Hitler. I stated that very serious harm was being done to my
foreign trade policy by the arbitrary and inhuman cultural and legal
policy which was being carried out by Hitler. I pointed in particular
to the hostile attitude towards the churches and the illegal
treatment of the Jews and, furthermore, to the absolute illegality
and despotism of the whole Gestapo regime. I remember in that
connection that I referred to the British Habeas Corpus Act, which
for centuries protected the rights of the individual; and I stated
word for word that I considered this Gestapo despotism to be
something which would make us despised by the whole world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler read both parts of this memorandum while still on board
the <span class='it'>Scharnhorst</span>. As soon as he had read it he called me and tried
to calm me down by making statements similar to those which he
had already made to me in July 1934, when he told me these were
still the transitional symptoms of a revolutionary development and
that as time went on this would be set right again and disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The events of July 1934 had taught me a lesson, however, and
consequently I was not satisfied with this explanation. A few
weeks afterwards, on 18 August 1935, I used the occasion of my
visit to the Eastern Fair Königsberg to mention these very things
in the speech which I had to make there; and here I gave clear
expression to the same objections which I had made to Hitler aboard
the <span class='it'>Scharnhorst</span> at the beginning of May.
<span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not talk only about the Church question, the Jewish
question, and the question of despotism; I talked also about the
Free Masons; and I shall quote just a few sentences from that
speech (Exhibit Number Schacht-25), with the permission of the
Tribunal. They are very short. I am speaking about people, and I
now quote...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Just one moment. I want to tell the Tribunal that this
is the Königsberg speech, which I submitted to the Tribunal this
morning as a document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I am talking about people and I now quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...people who under cover of darkness heroically smear
window panes, who brand as a traitor every German who
trades in a Jewish store, who declare every former Free
Mason to be a scoundrel, and who in the fight against priests
and ministers who talk politics from the pulpit, cannot
themselves distinguish between religion and misuse of the
pulpit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>End of quotation, and then another sentence. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In accordance with the present legislation and in accordance
with the various declarations made by the Führer’s Deputy,
the Reich Minister of the Interior, and the Reich Minister for
Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (not to mention the
Ministry of Economics), Jewish businesses are permitted to
carry on their business activities as heretofore.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>End of quotation, and then, in the last sentences, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“No one in Germany is without rights. According to Point 4
of the National Socialist Party program the Jew can be
neither a citizen nor a fellow German. But Point 5 of the
Party program provides legislation for him too; that means,
he must not be subjected to arbitrary action but to the law.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I assumed the same attitude on every other further occasion
that offered itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One moment, Dr. Schacht; did the regime tolerate this
speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It is a good thing that you remind me of that; because
in the course of the Gisevius testimony the same question was
discussed with reference to the Marburg speech of Herr Von Papen.
Since up to then my speeches were not subject to censorship—of
course I would not have allowed that—this speech was broadcast
by mistake, so to speak, over the Deutschlandsender. In that way
the speech was brought to the notice of Propaganda Minister
Goebbels, and at once he issued an order prohibiting the publication
of the speech in the newspapers. As a result, although the speech
<span class='pageno' title='515' id='Page_515'></span>
was broadcast by the Deutschlandsender it did not appear in any
newspaper. But as, fortunately, the Reichsbank had its own printing
press which was of course not subject to censorship, I had the
speech printed in the Reichsbank printing press; and 250,000 copies
of it were distributed to the 400 branches of the Reichsbank throughout
the country, and in that manner it became known to the entire
population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You were going to continue, were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I wanted to go on and say that on every future
opportunity which I could find I always returned to these points.
I should like to touch upon only two more things in this connection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning I referred to these things in connection with the
letter written by me on 24 December 1935 to the Reich Minister of
War, which is Document Number EC-293. I should merely like to
add and point out the words, which I shall now quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The economic and legal policy for the treatment of the Jews,
the anti-Church activities of certain Party organizations, and
the legal despotism associated with the Gestapo are detrimental
to our armament program...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The same attitude can also be seen from the minutes of the so-called
“small Ministerial Council” for 12 May 1936, which have been
submitted in evidence by the Prosecution. It says in these minutes,
and I quote: “Dr. Schacht emphasized openly again and again that
a cultural and legal policy must be pursued which does not interfere
with economy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to remark in this connection that, of course, as Minister
of Economics I always linked my arguments with the work of the
departments under the Minister of Economics. And, as a last
example, one of many others which I cannot mention today, there
is the speech on the occasion of a celebration for the apprentices at
the Berlin Chamber of Artisans on 11 May 1937 which is Exhibit
Number Schacht-30. On that occasion I said the following, and I
quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“No community and, above all, no state can flourish which is
not based on legality, order, and discipline.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And a second sentence, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“For that reason you must not only respect the right and the
law, but you must also act against injustice and unlawful
actions everywhere, wherever you find them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And because I made known my attitude not only to a close
circle but also to a wider public by using every opportunity to
voice my views frankly—because of this, a few weeks ago in this
court, the Chief of the RSHA, Department III, Security Service, the
<span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span>
witness Ohlendorf, in reply to a question, described me as an enemy
of the Party, at least since the year 1937-1938. I believe that the
Chief of the Security Service, the inland department, should know
since he had the task of combating political opponents inside
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I point out that the statements made during the
meeting of the small Ministerial Council on 12 May 1936 are contained
in my document book, Exhibit Schacht-20, Page 57 of the
English text, Page 51 of the German text and Schacht’s speech to the
Chamber of Industry and Commerce on 12 May 1937...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: [<span class='it'>Interrupting.</span>] You mean Chamber of Artisans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I shall refer to that later when I have the proper document;
and I now continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have talked about your participation at the Party rallies,
and I should merely like to ask you in addition: Did you participate
in any other Party functions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not remember that I ever participated in any
other functions of the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The Indictment charges you, in substance, with using
your personal influence and your close connections with the Führer
for the aims as set forth. Did you, as far as you know and can judge
from your experience, have any influence on the Führer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Unfortunately, I never had any influence on the
Führer’s actions and decisions. I had influence only insofar as he
did not dare to interfere with me in my special financial and economic
policies. But this lack of influence of all members of Hitler’s
entourage has already been mentioned by various witnesses and so
much has been said about it that I think I need not take up the
Tribunal’s time with any further statements on that subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What you have just said applies in the main to the
question of the influence of the Reich Cabinet, the last meetings of
the Reich Cabinet, and so forth. Various witnesses have made statements
on that subject. Have you anything new to add?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I can merely add that on the whole the Reich Cabinet
did not have the slightest influence on Hitler, and that from
November 1937 on—this has been stated repeatedly—there were no
more meetings or consultations of the Cabinet. The Reich Cabinet
was an uncorrelated group of politically powerless departmental
ministers without the proper professional qualifications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I should like to add that the number of the speech to
the Chamber of Artisans is Exhibit Number 30, Page 89 of the
English text and Page 82 of the German text.
<span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] What was the situation regarding
rearmament? Whose will was decisive and authoritative as regards
the extent of rearmament?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I am without any basis for judgment as far as that
is concerned. But I have no doubt that Hitler’s will, here too, was
the sole decisive and authoritative factor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is to say, you had no influence other than that of
the credit-giver?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Within my Ministry, insofar as I administered this
Ministry, I did nothing for which I would not assume responsibility
myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you speak to prominent foreigners about your lack
of influence on Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In this connection I recall a conversation with Ambassador
Bullitt in November 1937. This conversation with Ambassador
Bullitt has already been mentioned in some other connection,
and Ambassador Bullitt’s memorandum has been presented in
evidence to the Tribunal by the Prosecution. I merely refer to the
sentence which refers to me, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He”—that is to say Schacht—“prefaced his remarks by
saying that he himself today was ‘completely without
influence on that man’ ”—meaning Hitler. “He seemed to
regard himself as politically dead and to have small respect
for ‘that man.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was said in November 1937. But if I am permitted to add
to this, I want to point out that my foreign friends were kept constantly
informed about my position and my entire activity as
regards the directing of public affairs in Germany, as I have already
mentioned once before. This will be seen on later occasions when
various instances are mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: This morning I submitted Exhibit Number Schacht-22,
Page 64 of the English text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] And now a few special questions
regarding your position as Minister of Economics. You have already
made statements regarding the obtaining of foreign raw materials,
that is, you have quoted appropriate passages. Could these not be
substituted by home products in your opinion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: A portion of such raw materials could certainly be
replaced by home products. We had learned in the meantime how
to produce a large number of new materials which we did not know
about before...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Please be brief.
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: ...to produce them synthetically. But a considerable
part could not be replaced in that way and could be obtained only
through foreign trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And what was your attitude towards the question of
self-sufficiency?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As far as self-sufficiency was concerned I believe
that, if at a reasonable cost, without undue expenditure, which
would have meant a waste of German public funds and German
manpower, certain synthetic materials could be produced in Germany,
then one should do so, but that apart from this the maintenance
of foreign trade was an absolute necessity for economic
reasons, and that it was even more necessary for reasons of international
cultural relations so that nations might live together. I
always regarded the isolation of nations as a great misfortune, just
as I have always regarded commerce as the best means of bringing
about international understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Who was the exponent in the Reich Cabinet of the
self-sufficiency principle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As far as I know, the whole idea of self-sufficiency,
which was then formulated in the Four Year Plan, originated with
Hitler alone; after Göring was commissioned with the direction of
the Four Year Plan, then Göring too, of course, represented that
line of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you express your contradictory views to Göring
and Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think it is clear from the record that I did so at
every opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One incidental question: You will remember that
Göring exclaimed, “I should like to know where the ‘No men’ are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I want to ask you now, do you claim this honorary title of “No
man” for yourself? I remind you particularly of your letter of
November 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: On every occasion when I was no longer in a position
to do what my inner conviction demanded, I said, “No.” I was not
content to be silent in the face of the many misdeeds committed by
the Party. In every case I expressed my disapproval of these things,
personally, officially, and publicly. I said “No” to all those things.
I blocked credits. I opposed an excessive rearmament. I talked
against the war and I took steps to prevent the war. I do not know
to whom else this honorary title of “No man” might apply if
not to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you not swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler?
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not swear an oath of allegiance to a certain
Herr Hitler. I swore allegiance to Adolf Hitler as the head of the
State of the German people, just as I did not swear allegiance to the
Kaiser or to President Ebert or to President Hindenburg, except in
their capacity as head of the State; in the same way I did not swear
an oath to Adolf Hitler. The oath of allegiance which I did swear
to the head of the German State does not apply to the person of the
head of the State; it applies to what he represents, the German
nation. Perhaps I might add something in this connection. I would
never keep an oath of allegiance to a perjurer and Hitler has turned
out to be a hundredfold perjurer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Göring has made extremely detailed explanations
regarding the Four Year Plan, its origin, its preparation, technical
opposition by you, and the consequences you took because of this
opposition. Therefore we can be brief and deal only with new
material, if you have something new to say. Have you anything to
add to Göring’s statements or do you disagree on points which you
remember or about views held?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I gather from Göring’s statements that he has described
conditions perfectly correctly and I myself have nothing at
all to add unless you have something special in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: According to your impressions and the experience you
had, when did Hitler realize that you were an obstacle in the way
of a speedy and extensive rearmament? Did he acknowledge your
economic arguments? Was he satisfied with your policy or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: At that time, in 1936, when the Four Year Plan was
introduced in September I could not tell what Hitler’s inner attitude
to me was in regard to these questions of economic policy. I might
say that it was clear that after my speech at Königsberg in August
1935 he mistrusted me. But his attitude to my activities in the field
of economic policy was something which I was not yet sure of in
1936. The fact that I had not in any way participated in the preparation
of the Four Year Plan but heard about it quite by surprise
during the Party Rally and that, quite unexpectedly, Hermann
Göring and not the Minister of Economics was appointed head of
the Four Year Plan, as I heard for the first time at the Party Rally
in September 1936—these facts naturally made it clear to me that
Hitler, as far as economic policy with reference to the entire rearmament
program was concerned, did not have that degree of confidence
in me which he thought necessary. Subsequently, here in
this prison, my fellow Defendant Speer showed me a memorandum
which he received from Hitler on the occasion of his taking over the
post of Minister and which, curiously enough, deals in great detail
with the Four Year Plan and my activities, and is dated August 1936.
<span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span>
In August 1936 Hitler himself dictated this memorandum which has
been shown to me in prison by my fellow Defendant Speer, and I
assume that if I read a number of brief quotations from it with the
permission of...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I just want to give an explanation to the Tribunal. We
received the original of this memorandum about three weeks ago
from the Camp Commander of the Camp Dustbin through the kind
mediation of the Prosecution. We then handed it in for translation
so that we might submit it now. But the translation has not yet
been completed. I shall submit the entire memorandum under a
new exhibit number when I receive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has any application been made in respect
to it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: No application has been made as yet. I wanted...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which memorandum? Who drew it up?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is a Hitler memorandum of the year 1936, of which
there exist three copies; and one of them was in the Camp Dustbin.
This copy arrived here a fortnight or three weeks ago after we had
discussed our document books with the Prosecution. I intended to
submit the translation of the Hitler memorandum today and at the
same time to ask that this be admitted in evidence, but unfortunately
I am not in a position to do so because the translation is not
yet ready. My colleague, Professor Kraus, was in fact told that it
has been mislaid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, let the defendant go on, and you
can submit the document in evidence and a translation afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well. The defendant has a copy and he will
quote the most important, very brief passages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I shall quote very brief passages. Hitler says in this
memorandum, among other things, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is, above all, not the task of State economic institutions
to rack their brains about methods of production. This does
not concern the Ministry of Economics at all.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Ministry of Economics was under me, and this is therefore
a reproach for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A further quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is furthermore essential that German iron production be
increased to the utmost. The objection that we are not in a
position to produce the same cheap raw iron from German
ore, which has only 26 percent of iron content, as from the
45 percent Swedish ores, is unimportant... The objection that
in this case all the German smelting works would have to be
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>
reconstructed is also irrelevant; and, in any case, this is none
of the business of the Ministry of Economics.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As is apparent from the statement, I had explained that from
26 percent ore one could produce steel only at costs twice or three
times those at which one could produce steel from 45 percent ore.
And I explained further that, in order to use 26 percent ore, one
would have to have completely different plants from those using
45 percent ore. Herr Hitler states that this is none of the business
of the Ministry of Economics, and that, of course, means Herr
Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one last, very brief quotation. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I want to emphasize in this connection that in these tasks
I see the only possible economic mobilization and not in the
curbing of the armament industry...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That statement, too, is directed, of course, against my policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We have now reached the stage of tension of technical
differences between you and Göring, the tension between you and
Hitler regarding your functions as Minister of Economics. What
were your thoughts at the time about resigning from your office
as Minister of Economics? Was it possible for you to resign? Please
do not repeat anything that Lammers and other witnesses have
already told us about the impossibility of resigning. Please talk
only about your own special case and what you yourself did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: First of all, I tried to continue my own economic
policy, in spite of the fact that Göring as head of the Four Year
Plan tried, of course, as time went on to take over as many of the
tasks concerned with economic policy as possible. But the very
moment Göring encroached on my rights as Minister of Economics
I used it as an opportunity to force my release from the Ministry
of Economics. That was at the beginning of August 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time I told Hitler very briefly the reason, namely, that
if I was to assume responsibility for economic policy, then I would
also have to be in command. But if I was not in command, then
I did not wish to assume responsibility. The fight for my resignation,
fought by me at times with very drastic measures, lasted
approximately two and a half months until eventually Hitler had
to decide to grant me the desired release in order to prevent the
conflict from becoming known to the public more than it already
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When you say “drastic measures” do you mean your
so-called sit-down strike?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection I want to submit to the Tribunal Exhibit
Number Schacht-40 of my document book, an affidavit from another
<span class='pageno' title='522' id='Page_522'></span>
former colleague of Dr. Schacht in the Reich Ministry of Economics,
Kammerdirektor Dr. Asmus. On Page 180 of the English version
of this long affidavit there is a brief passage. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When this was found to be unsuccessful”—it means his
fight—“and when developments continued along the course
which he considered wrong, he”—Schacht—“in the autumn
of 1937, long before the beginning of the war, acted as an
upright man and applied for release from his office as Reich
Minister of Economics and thereby from his co-responsibility.</p>

<p>“He was obviously not able to resign his office in the normal
way, because for reasons of prestige the Party required the
use of his name. Therefore, in the autumn of 1937, he
simply remained away from the Ministry of Economics for
several weeks. He started this sit-down strike, as it was
humorously called in the Ministry, and went in his official
capacity only to the Reichsbank...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, is it necessary to trouble the Tribunal
with all this detail? There is no dispute that he did resign,
and the only thing that he has got to explain is why he continued
to be a Minister. The Prosecution have given evidence about his
resignation and about the conflict between him and the Defendant
Göring. What is the good of going into all the detail of it, as
to this sit-down strike and that sort of thing? That doesn’t interest
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: He did not remain a Minister at that time. He resigned
as Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I thought he had remained a Minister until
1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Minister without Portfolio, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t say Minister with Portfolio, I said
Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, but there is a difference, but I shall come to that
later. I understood you to mean an active Minister, but I shall not
go into that now. It was a misunderstanding. Anyway, I have
already finished that. I was merely trying to show how difficult
it was to resign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] We now come to the manner in
which you were released. Have you anything to add to the statements
made by Lammers in this connection or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think we should inform the Tribunal of one matter
about which I also learned here in prison from my fellow Defendant
Speer. He overheard the argument between Hitler and
<span class='pageno' title='523' id='Page_523'></span>
myself on the occasion of that decisive conference in which I
managed to push through my resignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal allow, I shall read it very briefly. There are
two or three sentences. Herr Speer informed me of the following:
“I was on the terrace of Berghof on the Obersalzberg, and I was
waiting to submit my building plans. In the summer of 1937 when
Schacht came to the Berghof...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] Speer is present in the
room. For one defendant to testify as to a conversation with
another defendant is a very convenient way of getting testimony
without access to cross-examination, but it seems to me that it is
a highly objectionable method. I object to this on the ground that
it has no probative value to testify to a conversation of this
character when the Defendant Speer is in the courtroom and can be
sworn and can give his testimony. He sits here and is available.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the subject of the conversation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The subject of this conversation is a matter which
concerns the Defendant Schacht. It is a statement of Hitler regarding
Schacht; it is not a matter which concerns the Defendant Speer.
Therefore I consider it expedient for him, since it is a matter which
concerns Schacht, to be able to make a statement about it. I would,
of course, consider it more appropriate that he should not read
something which Speer has written to him, but that he should
give his own account of what happened between Hitler and Schacht
and merely say, “I heard that from Speer.” That appears to be
better than...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, Dr. Dix, you may give that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Will you please not read,
then, but tell of this incident and say you got it from Speer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is even more objectionable to
me than to have a written statement from Speer. If we are to
have Speer’s testimony, it at least should be Speer’s and not a
repetition of a conversation between the two defendants. If Speer
has made a written statement, it can be submitted to us in the
ordinary course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the second document that we have not had the privilege
of seeing before it has been used here; and it seems to me that if
this is a document signed by Speer—which I don’t understand it to
be—if it is, that is one thing. We can then see it and perhaps it
can be used. If it is a conversation, I should prefer Speer’s version.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I add something? The question of procedure is
not of basic importance for me here. In that case it can be discussed
when Speer is examined. However, I do not know whether
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span>
Speer is going to be called; probably he will be. Actually it would
be better for us to hear it now, but I leave it to the Tribunal to
decide. It is not a question of great importance to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will allow the evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Well then, without reading,
please describe the incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The gentlemen on the terrace, among them Speer,
heard this discussion, which was conducted in very loud tones.
At the end of the discussion Hitler came out on the terrace and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just a moment. [<span class='it'>There was a brief pause in
the proceedings.</span>] Very well, Dr. Dix, go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Hitler came out on the terrace after this conference
and said to those present, among them Speer, that he had had a
very serious argument with Schacht, that he could not work with
Schacht, and that Schacht was upsetting his financial plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well then, after you had left your position as Minister
of Economics you were still left authority as Reichsbank President.
Were you approached by Hitler or the Minister of Finance in your
capacity as President of the Reichsbank and asked for credit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: After the Reichsbank had discontinued giving
credits, on 31 March 1938, the Reich Minister of Finance of course
received more urgent demands for money and toward the end of
that year he found himself in the awkward situation of not being
able to pay even the salaries of the civil servants from the treasury.
He came to me and asked me to grant him a special credit. According
to its charter and laws the Reichsbank was entitled and to
a certain extent obliged, but actually only entitled, to advance to
the Reich up to 400 million marks per annum. The Reich Minister
of Finance had received these 400 million marks and he was asking,
over and above that, for further credits; the Reichsbank refused
to give him these credits. The Reich Minister of Finance had to go
to the private banks and all the large banks together gave him a
credit of a few hundred million marks. However, the Reichsbank
did not participate in this credit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: If you as President of the Reichsbank turned down
those credits, then it seems there was nothing for it but to print
more notes. Did Hitler or anyone else suggest to you that the note
printing presses should be set in motion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: After the events of November 1938 I paid one more
visit to London, in December, to attend a conference regarding the
financing of the Jewish emigration from Germany in an orderly
manner—a thing which I myself had suggested. On that occasion
<span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span>
I also talked with Prime Minister Chamberlain. On 2 January
1939 I arrived at the Berghof in Berchtesgaden to report to Hitler
about these matters. On that occasion we, of course, also got to
talk about the financial needs of the Reich. I still refused to give
credit to the Reich, and pointed out the very difficult financial
situation which called for, or should have called for, a reduction
of State expenditure and thus of armament expenditure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In particular, I pointed out that at the beginning of December
the first instalment of the so-called Jewish fine—which had been
imposed on the Jews after the murder of Herr Vorn Rath in Paris
and which had been collected to the extent of 250 million marks
at the beginning of December—that this first instalment of 250 million
marks had not been received entirely in the form of cash, but
that the Reich Minister of Finance had had to agree to accept a
considerable part of it “in kind,” as the English say, because it was
not possible to make liquid the cash necessary for this payment.
Hitler replied: “But we can circulate notes on the basis of these
goods. I have looked into the question of our future financial policy
very carefully and when I get back to Berlin in a few days I shall
discuss my plans with you and the Minister of Finance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw at once that it was Hitler’s intention to resort to the
printing of notes to meet this expenditure with or without the
necessary cover, but at any rate against certain securities. The
danger of inflation was now definitely imminent. And since I
realized at once that this was the point where I and the Reichsbank
had to say “stop,” I replied to him, “Very well, in that case I will
get the Reichsbank to submit a memorandum to you, setting out
the attitude of the Reichsbank to this problem and which can be
used at the joint meeting with the Finance Minister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that I went back to Berlin and informed my colleagues
in the Reichsbank Directorate. We saw, to our personal satisfaction,
that here was an opportunity for us to divorce ourselves definitely
from that type of policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memorandum dated 7 January which the Reichsbank Directorate
then submitted to Hitler has, I think, also been submitted as
evidence by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to explain the statements which the Reichsbank Directorate
made to Hitler in this decisive moment regarding further
State expenditure and especially armament expenditure, I ask
permission to read only two very brief sentences from this memorandum.
It says, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Unrestrained public expenditure constitutes a definite threat
to our currency. The unlimited growth of government expenditure
defies any attempts to draw up a regulated budget.
<span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span>
It brings State finances to the verge of ruin despite a
tremendous increase in taxes, and it undermines the
currency and the issuing bank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then there is another sentence, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...if during the two great foreign political actions in
Austria and the Sudetenland an increase in public expenditure
was necessary, the fact that after the termination of these
two foreign political actions a reduction of expenditure is
not noticeable and that everything seems rather to indicate
that a further increase of expenditure is planned, makes it
now our absolute duty to point out what the consequences
will be for our currency.</p>

<p>“The undersigned Directors of the Reichsbank are sufficiently
conscious of the fact that in their co-operation they have
gladly devoted all their energy to the great aims that have
been set, but that a halt must now be called.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: This memorandum has already been submitted by
the Prosecution under the Document Number EC-369, but it is
being submitted again as Exhibit Schacht-24 in our document book,
Page 70 of the English text, and Page 63 of the German text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall have to put various questions to Dr. Schacht on that
memorandum, but I think that perhaps there is not time now and
that I should do so tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you must, Dr. Dix; but do you think that
is very important? At any rate, you had better do it tomorrow,
if you are going to do it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, can you inform us whether
those extracts are the same as the extracts which were refused in
the case of the Defendant Ribbentrop?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I have made a comparison, and I can hand it to
the Tribunal in writing. Some documents are the same, some do
not tally, and some are missing. I have done that in writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, the Tribunal would like to
know exactly what your letter means, which they received from
you, relating to the following documents which the letter says have
been withdrawn. What I want to know is, does it mean that they
are not to be translated? Let me read you the numbers: 18, 19, 48,
53, 76, 80, 81, 82, 86, and 101. Now, does your letter mean that
those documents are not to be translated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: No, Your Lordship; that means that the British
Delegation informed me yesterday morning that the objections
against those documents on the part of the British Delegation are
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I had written the letter on 30 April, in the afternoon,
after I had had a conversation with Sir David. The following
morning I was informed...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We won’t bother with that. You say that
their objections no longer exist. If they agree to that, well
and good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, apparently there
seems to have been some misunderstanding about three of them,
Numbers 80, 101, and 76. The others were not objected to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, on 76 there seemed
to be some misunderstanding between Dr. Siemers and myself.
I understood that he did not want to persist in the legal report
on the <span class='it'>Altmark</span> incident, and I think Dr. Siemers thought that I
wasn’t persisting. However, I thought Dr. Siemers was withdrawing
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Well, then, are you still objecting
to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am still objecting to it if it is
not withdrawn, My Lord. However, the other ones in the list Your
Lordship mentioned—that is Numbers 18, 19, 48, 53, 81, 82, and
86—there is no objection to.
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Concerning Document 76, I agree with Sir David.
Number 76 can be struck out, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. That’s all I wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Number 80 about which I have spoken in detail
with the British Delegation...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You need not tell me about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I assumed there would be no objection. I would
like to ask that it be admitted in any case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, that is right. In order that the Translation
Division should get on as soon as possible, the Tribunal has
decided upon these documents and the only questions upon which
the Tribunal has decided is that they shall be translated. The
question of their admissibility will be decided after they have
been translated, and I will take them in the categories of objection
which are set out in Sir David’s memorandum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Category A, the first category, Number 66 will be allowed.
Number 76 as Dr. Siemers has now said, goes out. Numbers 101 to
106 will be allowed, the rest are disallowed in A. In B the following
documents will be allowed: Numbers 39, 63, 64, 99, and 100.
And, of course, Numbers 102 to 107, which are allowed under A.
The rest will not be allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Category C: The following will be allowed: Numbers 38, 50,
55, and 58. The remainder are not allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Category D: The following will be allowed: Numbers 29, 56, 57,
60, and 62.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Category E: The following will be allowed: Numbers 31, 32, 36,
37, 39, 41, and of course 99 and 101 which have already been
allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last category, Category F, the Tribunal has very great
doubts as to the relevance of any of the documents in that category,
but it will have them all translated with the exception of Document
73.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: My Lord, I wonder whether the
Tribunal would allow me to mention the document numbers of the
additional extracts from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> which were put in cross-examination
of Streicher. I had the numbers ready to present at a
convenient time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The exhibit numbers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean read them?
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: With the permission of the Tribunal,
I have proposed to hand in that schedule, which is in effect
a catalogue or index to the two bundles which the Tribunal had—Bundle
A and Bundle B—and I proposed then putting this schedule
in as an exhibit itself, which will become GB-450, (Document Number
D-833), and if the Tribunal agrees, that would save reading
any numbers out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: There is another request I would
make. The original of the newspaper, <span class='it'>Israelitisches Wochenblatt</span>,
was put in, or has been put in. Those volumes I have borrowed
from a library, and I was going to ask the Tribunal’s permission
to have the extracts photographed and to substitute with the
Tribunal’s Secretariat the photostats, and then take back the
originals so that they might be returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There seems no objection to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am very much obliged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have no objection to that, Dr. Marx?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: No, Mr. President, I have no objection to that. I
reserve the right to submit some counter documents if it should be
necessary. But the presentation of these documents is in accordance
with what Colonel Griffith-Jones stated in the course of the proceedings—if
they are submitted...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have a copy of this document here, this
exhibit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am asking you whether you had any objection
to the original of the Jewish newspaper being returned...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: ...after it is photographed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: No, I have no objection to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>LT. COL. GRIFFITH-JONES: I am very much obliged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now, Dr. Dix?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Schacht, I believe you still had to supplement your
answer to a question I put to you yesterday. I put to you the point
that different memoranda, letters, <span class='it'>et cetera</span> from you to Hitler were
full of National Socialist phraseology. I said you dealt with letters
and memoranda from the date of the seizure of power until later
when you went into opposition. The Prosecution, however, specifically
in the oral presentation of the charges, as I remember it,
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span>
referred to at least one letter which you addressed to Hitler before
the seizure of power in November 1932, and there is in the files
another letter of similar contents of August 1932. I think you should
state your position with respect to these two letters, supplementing
your answer to my question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHACHT: I explained to you yesterday already that up
to the decisive election of July 1932, I had in no way intervened
in the development of the National Socialist movement, but
remained completely aloof from it. After that movement achieved
its overpowering success in July 1932, of which I spoke yesterday,
I foresaw very clearly the development which would now result.
According to the principles of the democratic political concept
there was only one possibility, namely, that the leader of that
overwhelmingly large party would now have to form a new government.
I rejected from the first the other theoretical possibility
of a military government and a possibly resulting civil war, as
being impossible and incompatible with my principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, after I had recognized these facts I endeavored in
everything to gain influence over Hitler and his movement, and the
two letters which you have just mentioned were written in
that spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What did you know about Hitler’s plans against Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I never knew anything about plans against Austria.
Nor did I know in detail the plans Hitler had for Austria. I only
knew—like the majority of all Germans—that he was in favor of
an Anschluss of Austria with Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What did you know about his plans against Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I knew nothing of his plans against Czechoslovakia
until about the time of the Munich Conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you, after the Munich Conference, that is to say,
after the peaceful, so far peaceful settlement of the Sudeten
question, hear a remark of Hitler’s about Munich which was of
importance in your later personal attitude toward Hitler? Will
you tell the Tribunal the remark which you heard?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I say first that, according to my knowledge
of conditions at that time, Hitler was conceded in Munich more
than he had ever expected. According to my information—and I
expressed this also in the conversation with Ambassador Bullitt
at that time—it was Hitler’s purpose to gain autonomy for the
Germans in Czechoslovakia. In Munich the Allies presented him
with the transfer of the Sudeten-German territories on a silver
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span>
platter. I assumed, of course, that now Hitler’s ambition would be
more than satisfied and I can only say that I was surprised and
shocked when a few days after Munich I saw Hitler. I had no
further conversation with him at that time, but I met him with
his entourage, mostly SS men, and from the conversation between
him and the SS men I could only catch the remark: “That fellow
has spoiled my entry into Prague.” That is to say made it
impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently he was not satisfied with the great success which
he had achieved in foreign politics, but I mentioned when I spoke
about it yesterday the fact that I assumed from that remark that
he lacked the glory and a glamorous staging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And what were your feelings in regard to your whole
political attitude towards Hitler after Munich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In spite of the foreign political success I regretted
very deeply, and so did my close friends, that by this intervention
on the part of the Allied Powers, our attempt to remove the Hitler
regime was ruined for a long time to come—we did not know at
that time of course what would happen in the future—but, naturally,
at that moment we had to resign ourselves to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What did you know about Hitler’s plans against Memel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I knew nothing at all and never heard anything
about it. As far as I know, I learned of the annexation of Memel
by Germany on my trip to India, which I had already started at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And since you were in India at that time, you, of
course, heard nothing either about the negotiations, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, which
preceded the attack on Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I had no knowledge about that and therefore I also
knew nothing of the May meeting of 1939 which has been discussed
several times. In the beginning of March I left Berlin and
then stayed for some time in Switzerland; at the end of March I
set out for India via Genoa, and so I learned nothing at all about
the Hacha affair, that is the establishment of the protectorate in
Czechoslovakia, nor of Memel, nor of Poland, since I did not return
from the trip to India until the beginning of August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The invasions of Belgium, Holland, Norway, and Denmark
have been taken up here. Did you approve of these measures
and actions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Under no circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Were you ever able to express that disapproval anywhere
and how?
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Before the invasion of Belgium I was visited on
the order of the Chief of the General Staff, Halder, by the Quartermaster
General, the then Colonel, later General Wagner who after
the collapse committed suicide. He informed me of the intended
invasion of Belgium. I was shocked and I replied at that time,
“If you want to commit that insanity too, then you are beyond help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Before the march into Belgium. Exactly when it
was I could not say. It may have been already in November 1939.
It may have been in April 1940. I no longer know exactly when
it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Even though you did not approve of that action,
Germany was after all engaged in a life and death struggle. Did
not that cause you to put your active co-operation at her disposal,
since you were still Minister without Portfolio, though you no
longer held a special office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did anyone ask you to do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The visit, which I have just mentioned, of Quartermaster
General Wagner, upon order of the Chief of General Staff
Halder, was intended to persuade me to act in Germany’s interest
during the expected occupation of Belgium. I was to supervise and
direct currency, finance, and banking matters in Belgium. I flatly
refused that. Later I was approached again by the then Military
Governor of Belgium, General Von Falkenhausen, for advice concerning
the Belgian financial administration. I again refused to give
advice and did not make any statements or participate in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When did you for the first time...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I could perhaps relate another instance when I was
approached. One day, shortly after America was drawn into
the war, I received a request from the newspaper published by
Goebbels, that, on account of my knowledge of American conditions,
I should write an article for <span class='it'>Das Reich</span>, to assure the German people
that the war potential of the United States should not be overestimated.
I refused to write that article for the reason that precisely
because I knew American conditions very well, my statement could
only amount to the exact opposite. And so I refused in this instance
also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When did you hear for the first time of the meeting
which we call here simply the Hossbach meeting, or the meeting
concerning the Hossbach protocol?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: To my great surprise, I was informed of that meeting
on 20 October 1945, here in my cell, and I was extremely
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span>
astonished that during all previous interrogations I had never been
asked about this record, because it can be seen clearly from it that
the Reich Government was not to be informed of Hitler’s intentions
for war and therefore could not know anything about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you take part in similar conferences which were
preparatory to attacks, for instance the meeting of November 1940
in which the attack on Russia was discussed? I do not wish to be
misunderstood—the Speer document which you spoke of yesterday
discusses an attack which according to Hitler was threatened by
Russia. I am speaking now of discussions in which the subject was
an attack on Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The fear of an attack from Russia dates back to
the fall of 1936 and therefore has as yet nothing to do with the
war. I never took part in any conference which indicated intentions
of war, consequently not in the conference on the intended
attack on Russia, and I never heard anything about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Does that also apply to the meeting of May 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: At the moment, I do not know which meeting that
is, but I did not in any way take part in any meeting in May 1941,
as during the entire period when I was Minister without Portfolio,
I never took part in any official conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then you also did not get any information about the
conferences which the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka had
in Berlin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not have the slightest knowledge of the
Matsuoka conference except what may perhaps have been said on
the radio or in the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Mention has been made in some way that you at one
time had made available 200,000 marks for Nazi propaganda purposes
in Austria. Is there any truth in this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have not the slightest knowledge of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now we come to your dismissal as President of the
Reichsbank. As you have heard, the Prosecution asserts that you
finally brought about your own dismissal in order to evade the
financial responsibility. I ask you to reply to that accusation and
to tell the Tribunal briefly but exhaustively the reasons and the
tactical deliberations leading to your dismissal and that of your
assistants. They appear here in the memorandum of the Reichsbank
Directorate which has been under consideration several times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I should like to divide the question into two parts:
The first question is whether I tried to rid myself of my office as
President of the Reichsbank. My answer to that question is a most
emphatic “yes.” Since the middle of 1938, we in the Reichsbank
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span>
always considered that if there were no change in policy, we in
no event wanted to continue in office, because—and that brings
me to the second part of the question—we did not want to assume
the responsibility which we were then expected to bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For everything which we did previously and for a defensive
rearmament in order to achieve equal rights for Germany in international
politics, we gladly assumed responsibility, and we assume
it before history and this Tribunal. But the responsibility for continuing
rearmament which possibly in itself constituted a serious
potential danger of war or which would ever aim at war intentionally—that
responsibility none of us wanted to assume. Consequently,
when it became clear that Hitler was working toward a
further increase in rearmament—and I spoke about that yesterday
in connection with the conversation of 2 January 1939—when we
became aware of that we wrote the memorandum which was openly
quoted and is in the hands of this Tribunal as an exhibit. It indicates
clearly that we opposed every further increase of state expenditure
and would not assume responsibility for it. From that, Hitler
gathered that he would in no event be able to use the Reichsbank
with its present Directorate and President for any future financial
purposes. Therefore, there remained only one alternative; to change
the Directorate, because without the Reichsbank he could not go on.
And he had to take a second step; he had to change the Reichsbank
Law. That is to say, an end had to be put to the independence of
the Reichsbank from government decrees. At first he did that in a
secret law—we had such things—of 19 or 20 January 1939. That law
was published only about 6 months later. That law abolished the
independence of the Reichsbank and the President of the Reichsbank
became a mere cashier for the credit demands of the Reich, that is
to say, of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reichsbank Directorate did not want to continue along this
line of development. Therefore, on 20 January the President of the
Reichsbank, the Vice President, and the main financial expert, Reichsbank
Director Huelse, were dismissed; three other members of the
Directorate of the Reichsbank, Geheimrat Vocke, Director Erhard,
and Director Blessing pressed insistently for their resignation from
the Reichsbank until it was also granted. Two other members of
the Reichsbank Directorate, Director Puhl, whose name has been
mentioned here already, and an eighth director, Director Poetschmann,
remained in the Directorate even under the new conditions.
They were both Party members, the only ones in the Directorate,
and therefore they could not easily withdraw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is one accusation which is made by the Prosecution
concerning your reasons for writing the memorandum, that
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
is to say, to evade the financial responsibility. The second accusation
is that not a word of this memorandum expressly mentions
limitation of armaments, but that it essentially treats only matters
of currency, technical questions of finance, and economic considerations;
and that it was therefore the Dr. Schacht who in his capacity
of Bank Director was concerned about the currency, rather than the
opponent of rearmament, who made himself heard by this memorandum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is necessary that as co-author of the memorandum—as its
main author—you state your position with regard to this incriminating
interpretation of the memorandum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Even at an earlier time I said here that every objection
which I made and had to make to Hitler—and that applies not
only to myself but to all ministers—could only be made with arguments
arising out of the particular department administered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had I said to Hitler, “I shall not give you any more money
because you intend to wage war,” I should not have the pleasure
of conducting this animated conversation here with you. I could
then have consulted a priest, and it would have been a very one-sided
affair because I would have lain silently in my tomb, and the
priest would have delivered a monologue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: This memorandum is certainly very important, and
therefore we have to pause here for a moment. In summarizing—and
please check me—I believe I can express your views in this
way: This memorandum at the end contained demands such as
further means of raising funds by increase of taxation or else by
making use of the stock market—both impossible. Taxation could
not be increased any more. The stock market had just unsuccessfully
attempted a loan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If these actually impossible demands had been granted, the
Reichsbank would have created guarantees that no further funds
would be used for one or another form of rearmament. This success
was not to be expected; rather you could expect your dismissal. Did
my brief but comprehensive summary of this matter express your
views correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That entire letter was composed in such a way that
there were only two possible answers to it; either an alteration of
financial policy—and that meant a stop to rearmament, which would
have amounted to a complete change of Hitler’s policy—or else the
dismissal of the Reichsbank President; and that happened. We expected
it because at that time I no longer believed that Hitler would
change his policy so completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Therefore, the Prosecution are right in saying that your
mission ended with your dismissal.
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Hitler certainly confirmed that himself and in the
letter of dismissal to me said it expressly. We heard from the testimony
of Herr Lammers in this Court that Hitler with his own hand
wrote that addition into the letter, that my name would remain
connected with the first stage of rearmament. The second stage of
rearmament I rejected and Hitler understood that very clearly,
because when he received that letter from the Reichsbank he said
to those who were present: “This is mutiny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: How do you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The witness Vocke who will, I hope, appear in this
Court will testify to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Furthermore, the Prosecution asserted that your exit
from the political stage could not be attributed to your policy of
opposition to a war but to disputes with Hermann Göring over
power and rank. As such, that accusation seems to me to have been
refuted already by statements which Göring and Lammers have
made up to now. We do not wish to recapitulate. I merely want
to ask you whether you have anything to add to the statements
made on this subject by Göring and Lammers, or whether you disagree
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In his oral presentation the prosecutor said that
throughout the entire material which he had studied he could not
find one piece of evidence for my opposition to a policy of war. I
can only say in this respect: If someone on account of his shortsightedness
does not see a tree on a level plain, there is surely no
proof that the tree is not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You have heard from the Prosecution that you are
accused of having remained a member of the Cabinet as a Reich
Minister without Portfolio. That was also the cause for misunderstanding
yesterday. I merely wanted to express yesterday that you
had resigned as an active minister and head of a department, that
you resigned as Minister of Economy and His Lordship correctly
pointed out, that of course you remained a Minister without Portfolio,
that is without a special sphere of activity until January 1943.
Of that you are accused by the Prosecution. What caused you to
remain Reich Minister without Portfolio? Why did you do that?
Did you have any particular financial reasons? Excuse my mentioning
that, but the trial brief, on Page 5, charges you with that
motive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have already repeatedly explained here that my
release from office as Minister of Economy encountered very great
difficulties, and you have also submitted several affidavits confirming
the fact.
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler did not, under any circumstances, want it to be known
that a break or even so much as a difference of opinion had occurred
between one of his assistants and himself. When he finally approved
my release, he attached the condition that nominally I should remain
Minister without Portfolio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the second accusation, it is as unworthy as it is wrong.
There was a law in Germany that if a person held two public offices
he could be paid only for one. Since I was in addition President of
the Reichsbank I continuously received my income from the Reichsbank,
at first my salary and later my pension; therefore as a minister
I drew no salary whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you then, during the entire period of your position
as Reich Minister without Portfolio, have any other function to fulfill
in that capacity? Did you take any part in important decisions
of the Cabinet, did you participate in discussions—in brief, was the
Minister without Portfolio just a fancy dress major or was the position
one of substance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have already emphasized again and again in this
Court—and I can only repeat it again—that after I left the Reichsbank
I had not a single official discussion; I did not take part in a
single ministerial or official conference and that, unfortunately, it
was not possible for me to bring up any subject for discussion; for
I had no factual basis or pretext for such a possibility, for the very
reason that I had no particular field to administer. I believe that I
was the only Minister without Portfolio—there were also a few
others—who was not active in any way at all. As far as I know,
Seyss-Inquart was undoubtedly Minister without Portfolio; he had
his administration in Holland. Frank was Minister without Portfolio
and had his administration in Poland. Schirach—I do not know
whether he was Minister without Portfolio; I think it has been mentioned
once, but I do not know if it is correct—he had his Austrian
administration in Vienna. I had nothing further to do with the state
administration or in any other way with the State or the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What about the ordinary course of affairs? Were there
perhaps any circulars sent out by Lammers on which you acted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: On the whole—and I think it is understandable after
what I have stated here—I watched carefully for every possibility
of intervening again in some way but I remember and state with
absolute certainty, that during the entire time until the collapse I
received all in all three official memoranda. The numerous invitations
to state funerals and similar social state functions really need
not be mentioned here as official communications. I did not participate
in these occasions either. However, these three instances are
interesting. The first time it was a letter from Hitler—pardon, from
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span>
Himmler—a circular or request or a bill proposed by Himmler who
intended to transfer court jurisdiction over the so-called asocial
elements of the population to the police, or rather the Gestapo, that
is to say, a basic principle of the administration of justice to separate
the functions of prosecution and judge...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Well, that is known, Dr. Schacht. You can assume that
is known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In regard to this question I immediately assented in
the copy of a letter which Reich Minister Frank had sent me in
which he took a stand against this basic violation of legal principles,
and the bill was not made law. It would indeed have been extremely
regrettable, because I am firmly convinced that I myself was a definite
anti-social element in Himmler’s sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second instance was a letter concerning some discussions
about state property in Yugoslavia, after we had occupied Yugoslavia.
I answered that since I had not taken part in the preliminary
discussions on the draft of the law I should not be counted upon to
assist in this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the third incident—and this is the most important—occurred
in November 1942. Apparently by mistake there came into
circulation the draft for a law of the Reich Minister for Air, which
contained the suggestion of taking 15 and 16 year old students away
from the high school to enlist them for military service in the anti-aircraft
defense, the so-called Flakdienst. I answered this letter
because it was a welcome opportunity for me to state for once my
opinion on the military situation in a long detailed reply which I
sent to Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: On the third of November?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It is a letter of 30 November, which on the second
of December I believe was given personally by my secretary to the
adjutant of Göring in a closed envelope, with the request that he
himself open it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: One moment, Dr. Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the Tribunal.</span>] That letter has already been submitted
under Document Number 3700-PS by the Prosecution, but
it is also in our document book under Exhibit Number 23; Page 66
of the English text and Page 59 of the German text. If we were not
so pressed for time, it would have been especially gratifying for
me to read this letter here in full. It is a very fine letter. However,
I want to take time into consideration and I merely ask you,
Dr. Schacht, to state briefly your opinion of its content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will read the letter. It isn’t
necessary for you to read it now, is it?
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well. Well, then, would he speak quite briefly
about the letter before the recess or do you not wish to say anything
further?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I would like to say in this connection, if it is
permitted, that to my knowledge this letter has already been read
here by the American Chief Prosecutor, that is...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Read?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Or mentioned, or at least the most important points
were read. I believe it is sufficient if you submit the letter to the
Court in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, that has been done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, that constituted your entire activity as Reich Minister without
Portfolio?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, that was the end of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Therefore if one wanted to define your position in one
word, one would say, just a kind of retired major (Charaktermajor).</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I don’t know what a “Charaktermajor” is, at any
rate, I was never a major, but I have always had character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: But, Dr. Schacht, that is a historical remark about
authority conferred by Kaiser Wilhelm, the First as German Emperor
on Bismarck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think this is a convenient time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Dr. Schacht, we spoke of the letter, dated 30 November
1942, to Göring. Did that letter have any consequences?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, the letter had very considerable consequences.
It had the result that on 22 January I did at last receive my long
hoped-for release from my position of a nominal Minister without
Portfolio. The reason given for it, however, was less pleasant. I
believe the letter is already in the files of the Tribunal. It is a letter
attached to the official document of release from Lammers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, very well. We put a question on that subject
during Lammers’ hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. But I should only like to refer to the statement
which says: “...in view of your entire conduct in the present fateful
struggle of the German nation...”—so that was my whole attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Gentlemen of the Tribunal, it is Number 26 of the
document book. It is on Page 76 of the English text and on Page 69
of the German text.
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Please continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It was, therefore, my entire attitude during this war
which led to my dismissal, and the letter of dismissal also contained
the statement that I would be dismissed for the time being. According
to Lammers’ statement, as we have heard, this expression “for
the time being” was included in the letter, also on the Führer’s initiative.
I was very clearly aware of this wording when I received
the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later I was removed from the Prussian State Council,
of which I was a member—a body, incidentally, which had not met
for at least 8 years. At any rate, I was not at the meetings. Perhaps
it was 6 years, I do not know. The text of that decision was
communicated to me by the chairman of that State Council, Hermann
Göring, and because of its almost amusing contents, I still
recollect it very clearly. It stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“My answer to your defeatist letter undermining the power of
resistance of the German people is that I remove you from the
Prussian State Council.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I say it was amusing because a sealed letter written by me to
Göring could not possibly shake the power of resistance of the German
people. A further result was that Party Leader Bormann
demanded from me the return of the Golden Party Badge and I did
that at once. After that I was particularly closely watched by the
Gestapo. I gave up my residence in Berlin immediately, within
24 hours, and for the whole day the Gestapo spies followed me all
over Berlin both on foot and by car. Then I quietly retired to my
estate in the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, since the trial brief has mentioned material and
pecuniary reasons for the decisions which you made, it appears to
me justified and necessary to ask what was the position regarding
your property and your income after 1933? In your reply please
take into consideration that it is striking that in 1942 there was an
increase in your income.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: A few months ago, apparently with the approval of
the Military Government, there appeared in the press a list of donations
which the Party leaders and ministers in Germany received
and, in that connection, of their income and their property. I was
also listed, not under “donations,” but it was stated that in 1942 I
had an unusually high income. This list is incorrect, since it is a
gross figure which is mentioned and it does not take into consideration
the fact that the war profit tax was later deducted from
it. When the list was compiled the tax was not yet determined, so
that about 80 percent must be deducted from the sum which is given
there. The income is then no longer striking in any way. In regard
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span>
to my property, the list shows that over a period of 10 years it has
hardly changed, and I want to emphasize here particularly that in
the last 20 years my property remained approximately the same and
did not increase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: If I remember rightly you reduced your own salary as
President of the Reichsbank at a certain time on your own initiative?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: When, on Hitler’s suggestion, President Hindenburg
in March of 1933 appointed me again to the position of President of
the Reichsbank, Hitler left it to me to fix my own income. At that
time, I voluntarily reduced my income to less than 25 percent of
my former income from the Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you ever receive presents or donations from Hitler,
either in money or in valuables?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As I have just mentioned, I have never received any
kind of donations from Hitler, and I think he would hardly have
risked offering me one. I did, indeed, receive one present from
Hitler, on the occasion of my 60th birthday. He gave me a picture
which certainly had the value of about 20,000 marks. It was an oil
painting by a German painter Spitzweg; and would have been worth
approximately 200,000 marks if it had been genuine. As soon as the
picture was brought into my room I recognized it as a forgery, but
I succeeded about 3 months later in tracing the original. I started
proceedings on the subject of the genuineness of the picture, and the
forgery was established before a court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is not appropriate for the Tribunal to listen
to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did Hitler ever bestow on you the right to wear a uniform
or give you any kind of decoration or military rank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: If the Tribunal will permit me I would like to say
that I returned the forgery and it was never replaced; so that I have
received no presents from Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler offered me a uniform. He said I could have any uniform
I desired but I only raised my hands in refusal and did not accept
any, not even the uniform of an official, because I did not wish to
have a uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, another subject: Did you know anything about
the concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Already in the year 1933, when Göring established
concentration camps, I heard several times that political opponents
and other disliked or inconvenient persons were taken away to a
concentration camp. That these people were deprived of their liberty
perturbed me very much at the time, of course, and I continuously
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span>
demanded, as far as I was in a position to do so during conversations,
that the arrest and removal to concentration camps should
be followed by a clarification before the law with a defense and so
on, and suitable legal proceedings. At that early time the Reich
Minister of the Interior Frick also protested energetically along the
same lines. Subsequently this type of imprisonment, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>,
became less known in public, and in consequence I assumed that
things were slowly abating. Only much later—let us say the second
half of 1934 and 1935...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When you met Gisevius, you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, when I met Gisevius—I heard on repeated occasions
that not only were people still being deprived of their liberty,
but that sometimes they were being ill-treated, that beatings, <span class='it'>et
cetera</span>, took place. I have already said before this Tribunal that as
a result, as early as May 1935, I personally took the opportunity of
drawing Hitler’s attention to these conditions and that I told him
at the time that such a system was causing the whole world to
despise us and must cease. I have mentioned that I repeatedly took
a stand against all these things publicly, whenever there was a possibility
of doing so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I never heard anything of the serious ill-treatment and
outrages—murder and the like—which started later. Probably because,
firstly, these conditions did not begin until after the war,
after the outbreak of war, and because already from 1939 onwards
I led a very retired life. I heard of these things and of the dreadful
form in which they happened only here in prison. However, I did
hear, as early as 1938 and after, of the deportation of Jews; but
because individual cases were brought to my notice I could only
ascertain that there were deportations to Theresienstadt, where
allegedly there was an assembly camp for Jews, where Jews were
accommodated until a later date when the Jewish problem was to
be dealt with again. Any physical ill-treatment, not to speak of
killing or the like, never came to my knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you ever take a look at a concentration camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I had an opportunity of acquainting myself with
several concentration camps when, on 23 July 1944, I myself was
dragged into a concentration camp. Before that date I did not visit
a single concentration camp at any time, but afterwards I got to
know not only the ordinary concentration camps but also the extermination
camp in Flossenbürg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you not, while in Flossenbürg, receive a visit from
a “comrade-in-ideas”—if I may say so?
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I know of this matter only from a letter which this
gentleman sent to you or to this Tribunal, I believe, and in which
he describes that visit. I can only, on my own observation...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think it is improper to give the contents
of a letter from a person unidentified. I have said to this Tribunal
before that these letters which come from unidentified persons—if
he is identified, it has not been done in evidence—come to all
of us. I am sure members of the Tribunal get a great many of them.
If that is evidence, then the Prosecution should reopen its case,
because I have baskets of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it is highly improper to take communications and put
them in evidence directly and it is even more improper to relate all
of them by oral testimony when the document is not produced. I
think this kind of evidence has no probative value and I object to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I be permitted to say that I would never do anything
improper nor have I done it. I do not intend in any way to
submit this very harmless jocular letter to the Tribunal as evidence.
But this letter, which reached me through quite regular channels,
informed Dr. Schacht and myself that there existed a plan to murder
him in Flossenbürg. That is why I also questioned the witness
Kaltenbrunner on this matter. The only reason why I am asking
Dr. Schacht is that I expect him to inform the Tribunal that according
to this information there was in fact at that time an order to
murder him. This fact, not the letter, is not without some significance,
because if a regime wants to kill a man then that is at least
proof of the fact that it is not particularly well-disposed toward
him. That is the only reason why I asked that this letter be submitted,
and it is, of course, also at Mr. Justice Jackson’s disposal.
It is really quite an amusing letter, written by a simple man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I would never have considered submitting this letter as a
document in evidence. If the Tribunal have objections to hearing
the matter, a matter which was also discussed when Kaltenbrunner
was examined, then I shall willingly omit it. I am quite astonished
that the matter should be given so much significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, the Tribunal thinks that the letter
isn’t being offered in evidence, and therefore you ought not to refer
to it. Well, then, don’t refer to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: All right, we shall leave it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Well, now, at last you were released.
What did you do then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: After that time I did nothing more apart from continuing
my efforts towards the removal of Hitler. That was my
only political activity. For the rest, I was living on my estate.
<span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you not go on a journey in the spring of 1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Excuse me, you are speaking of the time after the
dismissal as President of the Reichsbank, I thought you meant minister.
I was just talking of 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: No. No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: You are going back to the year 1939. After the dismissal
in January 1939 I already mentioned that Hitler suggested
to me that I should go on an extensive journey abroad and at the
time I went to India by way of Switzerland, where I again saw
my friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Were you in any way politically active in India?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In India I merely traveled as a tourist. I was not
politically active but, of course, I visited several governors and I
spent 3 days as the Viceroy’s guest in his house in Simla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you not have political connections with Chinese
statesmen in Rangoon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: When I was in Burma, after leaving India, I received
a visit in Rangoon from a Chinese friend who had visited me before
in Berlin on occasion and who had been commissioned by his government
to talk to me about the Situation of China.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is Chiang Kai-Shek’s China?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Chiang Kai-Shek’s China which was already at war
with Japan at the time. The other China did not then exist and this
gentleman asked me upon the request of Chiang Kai-Shek and the
Chinese Cabinet...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I can’t see the slightest relevancy to
this. In the first place, we heard it once and secondly, after we had
heard it it has no relevancy to the case. We have no charge against
him that he did anything in China and we will stipulate that he
was as pure as snow all the time he was in China. We haven’t a
thing to do with that and it is taking time here that just gets us
nowhere and is keeping us away from the real charge in the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal quite understands that you say
it is irrelevant. Why do you say it is relevant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I regret that Mr. Justice Jackson and I understand each
other too little. The matter is relevant in the following connection:
In this testimony and also in an affidavit which has been read...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we heard three times that the Defendant
Schacht went to India. Three times in his evidence he dealt
with the fact that he went to India and China. How is it relevant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I am not speaking of the journey to India. It had to
be mentioned only briefly to explain the connection of time. I put
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span>
a question, referring to Schacht’s negotiations in Rangoon with the
envoy from Chiang Kai-Shek—with the Chinese—and at that point
Mr. Justice Jackson raised his objection. But the fact that Schacht
maintained friendly connections with Chiang Kai-Shek’s Government
and gave support to it, that fact is relevant, and for the same
reason for which I attached importance to the fact that it became
clear here that in regard to the Union of Soviet Republics also
Schacht pursued a pro-Soviet line in his economic policy during the
years when Hitler was conducting a political campaign against
Russia. Here we have a second instance, where he is demanding
relations which were contrary to the principles of Hitler’s policy;
that is relations with Chiang Kai-Shek, and so against Hitler’s ally,
Japan. It is in this connection that the negotiations with the
Chinese are of significance. They will take only a moment’s time
at most. They were merely to be mentioned in passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that if you consider his
relations with China of any importance, it can be stated in one
sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I am of the same opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I will sum it up in one sentence. In a written
memorandum I advised Chiang Kai-Shek’s government to continue
holding out against Japan, giving as reason that the economic
resources of China would last longer than the economic resources
of Japan; and I advised Chiang Kai-Shek to rely primarily
on the United States of America in his foreign policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then upon your return from India, that is, in August
1939, you found a situation which must have appeared quite tense
to someone who was just coming back. Did you not then attempt to
contact the Cabinet or Hitler in order to discuss this situation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Of course, I found a very tense situation in the question
of Poland and I used my return as an occasion for writing a
letter to Hitler, a letter to Göring, and a letter to Ribbentrop; that
is to say, the three leading men, in order to inform them that I had
come back from India, leaving it to their discretion and expecting
that at least one of them would ask me for an account of my
experiences; and then, I should have had an opportunity of talking
to the leading men once again. To my very great surprise, I did
not get an answer from Hitler at all; I received no reply from
Göring; and Herr Von Ribbentrop answered me that he had taken
note of my letter. There was therefore no other way for me but
to make my own inquiries regarding the real state of affairs on
Poland, and when things became critical I took the well-known step,
which has already been described here by Herr Gisevius; namely
the attempt to gain access to the Führer’s headquarters.
<span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: We need not repeat that. The only question which I
still want to ask you is what were you going to tell the generals,
particularly General Von Brauchitsch, at that last moment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That he still had a chance to avert a war. I knew
perfectly well that bare economic and general political statements
would of course accomplish nothing with Von Brauchitsch because
he would then certainly have referred to Hitler’s leadership. Therefore
I wanted to say to him something of quite a different nature
and, in my opinion, that is of the most decisive significance. I was
going to remind him that he had sworn an oath of allegiance to
the Weimar Constitution. I wanted to remind him that the
Enabling Act did not delegate power to Hitler but to the Reich
Cabinet and I wanted to remind him that in the Weimar Constitution
there was and still is a clause, which has never been annulled
and according to which, war cannot be declared without previous
approval by the Reichstag. I was convinced that Brauchitsch would
have referred me to his oath sworn to Hitler and I would have
told him: “I also have sworn this oath. You have sworn no oath
other than your military one, perhaps, but this oath does not in
any way invalidate the oath sworn to the Weimar Constitution; on
the contrary, the oath to the Weimar Constitution is the one that
is valid. It is your duty, therefore, to see to it that this entire question
of war or no war be brought before the Cabinet and discussed
there, and when the Reich Cabinet has made a decision, the matter
will go before the Reichstag.” If these two steps had been taken,
then I am firmly convinced that there would have been no war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You never reached Brauchitsch. We do not want to
repeat the description of that whole affair or of your attempts at
the Bendlerstrasse and so on. Have you anything to add to
Gisevius’ testimony or do you wish to change anything in it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I can only confirm that Gisevius’ statement is correct
in every single point and I myself merely want to add that Canaris
mentioned among many reasons which then kept us from making
the visit, that Brauchitsch would probably have us arrested immediately
if we said anything to him against the war or if we wanted
to prevent him from fulfilling his oath of allegiance to Hitler. But
the main reason why the visit did not come about was quite correctly
stated by Gisevius. Moreover it is also mentioned by General
Thomas in his affidavit which we shall later submit. The main
reason was: the war was canceled. And so I went to Munich on
a business matter and to my surprise while in Munich, war was
declared on Poland; the country was invaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: You mentioned the Reichstag a short time ago. A
meeting of the Reichstag did in fact take place, though not before
<span class='pageno' title='547' id='Page_547'></span>
the war or before the declaration of war, but immediately thereafter.
At the time you were still a Minister without Portfolio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Normally you would have had to sit on the minister’s bench
during that meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you take part in that meeting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not participate in that meeting at all and I
would like to add at once that during the entire war, I was present
at only one meeting of the Reichstag. I could not avoid it, considering
the matters which I already mentioned here yesterday. It
was after Hitler’s return from Paris. I had to participate in this
meeting of the Reichstag, which followed the reception at the
station because, as I said, it would otherwise have been too obvious
an affront. It was the meeting during which political matters were
not dealt with at all, but at which the field marshal’s rank was
granted by the dozen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now, this last effort which has just been mentioned
to stop the outbreak of war through Canaris brings us to the
particular chapter of your attempts at a coup to overthrow Hitler
and his government. We want to make it a rule, if possible, not
to repeat what the witness Gisevius has already stated but only
to supplement or correct or state what you know from your own
memory. Before I touch upon that chapter, however, may I ask
you whether you know from information you received or from
other indications, that your oppositional attitude and that of your
similarly minded friends, and your oppositional aims, were known
in authoritative circles abroad?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not wish to repeat anything; I merely want
to point out that I have already stated repeatedly here that I
continually discussed the situation in Germany—thus also my own
position—with my friends abroad—not only with Americans,
Englishmen, and Frenchmen but also with neutrals—and I would
like to add one more thing; foreign broadcasting stations did not
tire at all of speaking constantly about Schacht’s opposition to
Hitler. My friends and family received a shock whenever information
on this subject transpired in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: When did your attempts to overthrow the Hitler government
begin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As early as 1937 I tried to determine which groups
in Germany one might rely upon in an attempt to remove the
Hitler regime. Unfortunately in the years 1935, 1936, and 1937, I
got to know that all those circles in which I had placed my hope
were failing, namely the scientists, the educated middle class, and
the leaders of economy.
<span class='pageno' title='548' id='Page_548'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I need only mention that the scientists permitted themselves
to listen to the most nonsensical National Socialist lectures without
opposing them in the least. I call attention to the fact that when
the economic leaders saw that I was no longer a figure in economy,
they disappeared from my anteroom and thronged into that of
Göring. In a word, one could not rely upon these circles. Consequently,
one could depend only on the generals, on the military,
because according to my conception at the time, one could certainly
count on an armed resistance even by the SS bodyguard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, as has been stated here—and I do not want to pursue
it further—I tried at first to contact such generals as Kluge, for
instance, merely in order to ascertain whether among the military
there were people with whom one could speak openly. And this
first occasion led me to a great many generals whom I contacted in
the course of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That was then in the year 1937; now we come to
1938, still limiting ourselves by what Gisevius has already said,
merely touching on it briefly and confirming it. By the way, were
you in any way directly or indirectly involved in the negotiations
at Godesberg or Munich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In no way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Now we continue with your political work, aiming
at a revolt. Is Gisevius’ account of the year 1938 correct or is there
something to be added to it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Gisevius’ statement is complete and reliable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That also applies to the attempt at a <span class='it'>coup d’état</span> in
the late summer of 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then came the war. Did you fold your arms after
war broke out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No; throughout the entire war I pleaded with every
general whom I could contact. I used the same arguments which
I have just mentioned in connection with the prospective interview
with Brauchitsch; therefore, it was not merely theory, but I actually
spoke to all these generals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Was not a visit to General Hoeppner significant in
this connection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In 1941 I tried not only to get in touch with General
Hoeppner but in a whole series of conversations I attempted
to make him take action. Hoeppner was perfectly willing and prepared
and later he too, unfortunately, lost his life as a consequence
of 20 July 1944.
<span class='pageno' title='549' id='Page_549'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1942—and this has not been mentioned here up to
now, because Gisevius did not participate—I tried again to mobilize
General Von Witzleben to renewed activity. I went on a special
journey to Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where he had his headquarters
at that time, and Von Witzleben proved as ever to be completely
resolved to act, but he told me that, of course, he could only do so
if he again received a command at the front. Then I...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: At that time Frau Strünck, who knew of these matters,
was in Frankfurt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: She knew of these things and can confirm them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Perhaps I may tell the Tribunal at this point that
Frau Strünck was granted me as a witness and she was here. In
order to save time, however, I have decided to dispense with this
witness since she could make only cumulative statements on what
Gisevius has already said and I do not think it is necessary. Schacht
himself has just stated the only piece of information which she could
have added, namely this trip, this special journey to Frankfurt to
Von Witzleben. On the strength of experience the Tribunal will
itself know that in the course of a revolutionary movement,
stretching over years such as this, many journeys are made and
in respect to this particular journey it is not important to submit
special evidence. In order to save time, therefore, I have decided
to dispense with the testimony of Frau Strünck. Excuse me, I
merely wanted to say this now. Then there is the next...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I perhaps say one more thing? I of course
always participated in the conversations—mentioned by Gisevius
here—with the other generals, that is the group of Beck, Fromm,
Olbricht, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. These things did not come about for some time
on account of the negotiations abroad for which the generals were
always waiting. I think that enough has been said here about this
topic and I need not make further report on it. I come then to one
last point, which does not become apparent from Gisevius’ statement
but about which an affidavit from Colonel Gronau will be
submitted here. I can mention it quite briefly in order to save time.
Naturally, together with the group of Beck, Goerdeler, my friend
Strünck, Gisevius, and others I was completely informed of, and
initiated into, the affair of 20 July. However, and I think it was
mutual, we told each other whenever possible only those things
which the other absolutely had to know, in order not to embarrass
the other man, should he at any time be submitted to the tortures
of the Gestapo. For that reason, apart from being in touch with
Beck, Goerdeler, Gisevius, and Strünck, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, I had another
connection with the generals who were at the head of this revolt
and that was the General of Artillery Lindemann, one of the main
participants in the coup, who unfortunately also lost his life later.
<span class='pageno' title='550' id='Page_550'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Perhaps it would be proper—and also more intelligible
in connection with your participation in 20 July—if I read a brief
part of Colonel Gronau’s affidavit which refers to Lindemann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the Tribunal.</span>] It is Exhibit Number 39 of our document
book, Page 168 of the German text and Page 176 of the
English text. I shall omit the first part of the affidavit, but I ask
the Tribunal to take judicial notice of it; essentially it contains
only matters on which evidence has already been given. I shall
read only the part that deals with 20 July. It begins on Page 178
of the English text and on Page 170 of the German text, and I
start with Question 5:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question 5) You brought Schacht and General Lindemann
together. When was that?</p>

<p>“Answer 5) In the fall of 1943, for the first time in years,
I again saw General Lindemann, my former school and regiment
comrade. While discussing politics I told him that I
knew Schacht well, and General Lindemann asked to be introduced
to him, whereupon I established the connection.</p>

<p>“Question 6) What did Lindemann expect from Schacht, and
what was Schacht’s attitude toward him?</p>

<p>“Answer 6) The taking up of political relations with foreign
countries following a successful attempt at revolt. He promised
his future co-operation. At the beginning of 1944
Lindemann made severe reproaches that the generals”—that
should read “he severely reproached Lindemann”; it is
incorrectly copied here—“because the generals were hesitating
so long. The attempt at revolt would have to be made
prior to the landing of the Allies.”</p>

<p>“Question 7) Was Lindemann involved in the attempted assassination
of 20 July 1944?</p>

<p>“Answer 7) Yes, he was one of the main figures.</p>

<p>“Question 8) Did he inform Schacht of the details of this plan?</p>

<p>“Answer 8) Nothing about the manner in which the attempt
was to be carried out; he did inform him, however, of what
was to happen thereafter.</p>

<p>“Question 9) Did Schacht approve the plan?</p>

<p>“Answer 9) Yes.</p>

<p>“Question 10) Did Schacht put himself at the disposal of the
military in the event of a successful attempt?</p>

<p>“Answer 10) Yes.</p>

<p>“Question 11) Were you arrested after 20 July 1944?</p>

<p>“Answer 11) Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='551' id='Page_551'></span></p>

<p>“Question 12) How were you able to survive your imprisonment?</p>

<p>“Answer 12) By stoically denying complicity.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, we have left the years 1941 and 1942 and to explain the
Putsch in logical sequence we reached the year 1944, something that
could not be avoided, but we must now go back again to the year
1941. You have already mentioned, in passing, the efforts made
abroad. In 1941 you were in Switzerland. Did you make any efforts
in that direction there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Every time I went abroad I talked at length to my
foreign friends and again and again looked for some way by which
one might shorten the war and begin negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In this connection, the Fraser letter is of importance.
I think the Fraser letter and the way it was smuggled into Switzerland
has been sufficiently discussed by the witness Gisevius. I have
on two occasions stated the contents briefly, once when the translation
was discussed and again during the discussion on the admissibility
of the letter as evidence before the Court. I do not think
I need do it here nor that I need read it. I should merely like to
submit it. It is Exhibit 31, on Page 84 of the German and Page 91
of the English text. And—I say this now, we shall discuss it later—the
same applies to the article which appeared this year in the
<span class='it'>Basler Nachrichten</span> and which deals with a conversation which an
American had with Schacht recently. I shall not read that either
since I have already stated the main points of its contents. I submit
it as Exhibit Number 32, Page 90 of the German text and Page 99
of the English text. I might point out that this article has already
been the subject of certain accusations made during the cross-examination
of Gisevius by the representative of the Soviet Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I should like to raise one objection in regard
to Document 32; this is an article about Dr. Schacht and his ideas by
an unknown writer describing his conversations with an unknown
economist. The article in question was published in the <span class='it'>Basler
Nachrichten</span> on 14 January 1946, that is, when the present Trial was
already well under way, and I cannot consider that this article can
be presented in evidence with regard to Schacht’s case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I might—may I, before the Tribunal decides, say something
very briefly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The article has already been admitted as evidence. We
have discussed it, and the Tribunal approved the article as evidence.
The Tribunal can, of course, revoke that decision. I think, for me
it would...
<span class='pageno' title='552' id='Page_552'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think the Tribunal has always made it
clear that the allowance of these documents is a provisional allowance
and that when the document is actually offered in evidence,
they will then decide the relevancy or its admissibility, rather, and
its relevancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: That is quite beyond doubt. I merely wanted to point
out that we have already discussed the question once before. Of
course, the Tribunal can today reject the document. I shall...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The allowance is provisional. It is not a question
of the Tribunal’s reversing its previous decision. The previous
decision was merely provisional, and the question of admissibility
now comes up for decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is quite clear to me, Your Lordship. I am merely
surprised at the objection raised by the Soviet Prosecution, inasmuch
as the representative of the Soviet Delegation himself referred to
that article in his observations during the cross-examination of the
witness Gisevius. It is true, he did not submit it to the Tribunal,
but he referred to it in his observations to the witness Gisevius.
However, if the Tribunal has the slightest objections to allowing
the article as documentary evidence, then I shall ask permission to
leave it. I will then—and I think I may—ask the witness Schacht
whether it is true that in 1941 he had a conversation with an
American who was a professor of national economy, a conversation
which dealt with the possibility of peace. I leave it to the Tribunal.
For me, it is no—I thought it would be simpler, if I submitted the
article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, as you have raised the
objection to this document, what have you to say about the point
that Dr. Dix makes that you used the document yourself in cross-examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, we did not use this document
in the cross-examination of the witness Gisevius. An explanatory
question was asked in order to reach a decision on this point and
I particularly emphasize...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you say that again? I did not understand
you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I say, that we did not use this document
during the cross-examination of the witness Gisevius, but we did
ask an explanatory question in order that when the document was
presented by Dr. Dix, we could object to it as being of no probative
value. I especially...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But did you not put the contents of the
document to Gisevius? I do not remember. What I want to know
is did you not put the contents of the document?
<span class='pageno' title='553' id='Page_553'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: No, no, we did not submit the contents, and
we did not discuss the substance of the document. We merely
asked a question—did the witness Gisevius know about the article
in the <span class='it'>Basler Nachrichten</span> of 14 January 1946? That was the question,
and the witness answered that it was known to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I say one more thing? It appears to me that the
Soviet Delegation does not desire to have the article submitted as
evidence. I therefore withdraw it as evidence. And since I have
no due reasons to the contrary, no factual reason to the contrary,
1 can certainly fulfill this wish of the Soviet Delegation. I would
like the Tribunal to consider the matter as settled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I now put my question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Well, you had conversations in
Switzerland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: What was the subject of these conversations, in broad
outlines, and with whom did you have them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: This article, which has just been discussed...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: First, Your Honor, may I interpose
an objection? The reason I did not join in the Soviet objection to
this document was that I want to know who this economist is. I
want to check this thing. There are very peculiar circumstances
about this document, and I object to his retelling a conversation
with an unknown economist. All I ask is that he identify time and
place and person with whom he had his conversation, so that we
can do a little verifying of this effort to get something before the
Tribunal that did not appear until 1946.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: The question is now being given a significance which
its comparative triviality really does not merit. I shall, therefore,
dispense with this question too. Please do not now refer to the
conversation with the professor, and I shall leave it to the Prosecution
to put the question which Mr. Justice Jackson has just mentioned
during cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, your conversations in Switzerland, then, excepting that
with the unknown professor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I tried again and again to shorten the war and
to bring about some form of mediation which I always sought for
particularly through the good offices of the American President.
That is all that I can say here. I do not think I need go into details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well. Did you in your letters to Ribbentrop and
Göring—you have already mentioned Hitler—or besides, did you,
<span class='pageno' title='554' id='Page_554'></span>
during the war, state your views about the policy of the war in
writing at any time? First of all, as far as Hitler was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I mentioned my discussion with Hitler in February
1940. In the summer of 1941 I wrote a detailed letter to Hitler, and
the witness Lammers has admitted its existence. I do not think
he was asked about the contents of this letter here, or he was not
allowed to talk about it. If I may come back to it; in that letter,
I pointed out somewhat as follows—I shall use direct language—“You
are at present at the height of your success.”—This was after
the first Russian victories.—“The enemy believes that you are
stronger than you really are. The alliance with Italy is rather a
doubtful one, since Mussolini will one day fall and then Italy will
drop out. Whether Japan can still come to your aid at all is questionable
in view of Japan’s weakness in the face of America. I
assume that the Japanese will not be so foolish as to wage war
against America. The output of steel, for instance, in spite of
approximately similar population figures, amounts to one-tenth of
the American production. I do not think, therefore, that Japan will
enter into the war. I now recommend you at all events to reverse
foreign policy completely and to attempt with every means to conclude
a peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Did you state your views to Ribbentrop during the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know when it was. On one occasion Herr
Von Ribbentrop conveyed to me through his State Secretary, Herr
Von Weizsäcker, the reproachful message that I should not indulge
in defeatist remarks. That may have been in 1940 or in 1941,
during one of those 2 years. I asked where I had made defeatist
remarks and it appeared that I had talked to my colleague Funk
and had given him extensive reasons why Germany could never
win this war. I held this conviction unchangeable at all times
before and during the war, even after the fall of France. I answered
Ribbentrop through his State Secretary that I, as Minister without
Portfolio, considered it my duty to state my opinion to a ministerial
colleague in its true conception, and in this written reply I maintained
the view that Germany’s economic power was not sufficient
to wage this war. This letter, that is, a copy of this letter was sent
both to Minister Funk and to Minister Ribbentrop through his State
Secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I think, Your Lordship, this would be a suitable
moment...</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='555' id='Page_555'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I spoke before of 20 July. Do you recall a statement
made by Hitler about you in connection with 20 July?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Codefendant Minister Speer was present and told
me about it. It was on 22 July 1944 when Hitler issued the order
to his circle for my arrest. At that time he made derogatory
remarks about me and stated that he had been greatly hindered
in his rearmament program by my negative activities, and that it
would have been better if he had had me shot before the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: To conclude I come to a few general collective questions.
Voices were heard within the country, and also abroad—and
even the Prosecution, although recognizing your intellectual capacities
and the services you rendered, appears to consider it also—that
it was incomprehensible that a man as clever as you did not
recognize the true nature, the real intentions of Hitler in time. I
would like you to state your position with regard to that accusation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I should like very much to have known the gentlemen
who are now judging me, at a time when it might have been
of use. These are the people who always know afterwards what
ought to have been done before. I can only state that first of all,
from 1920 until the seizure of power by Hitler, I tried to influence
the nation and foreign countries in a way which would have prevented
the rise and seizure of power by a Hitler. I warned the
country to be thrifty but I was not heeded. I repeatedly warned
the foreign nations to develop an economic policy which would
enable Germany to live. I was not heeded, although as it now
appears, I was considered a clever and foresighted man. Hitler came
to power because my advice was not followed. The German people
were reduced to great economic need and neither...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President. For 2 days now we have been
listening to lengthy explanations on the part of the Defendant
Schacht, and I rather think that the explanations which have just
been given by the Defendant Schacht are not definite answers to
questions concerned with the Indictment brought against him, but
mere speeches. I consider that they will only prolong the Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, the Tribunal is, I think, fully apprised
with the case on behalf of Defendant Schacht. They don’t want to
stop him putting forward his defense fully, but they would be glad
if you could make it as short as possible and if he could make it
as short as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: My Lord, I am certain that I shall be through by the
recess, and perhaps even before the recess; but I beg you to bear
<span class='pageno' title='556' id='Page_556'></span>
in mind that the defendant is accused of having assisted in the seizure
of power. The question arises, how was it that...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I wasn’t ruling that this evidence was inadmissible.
I was only asking you to get on with it as quickly as you
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Very well. Dr. Schacht, please continue and try to
comply with the suggestions of the representative of the Soviet
Prosecution as far as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: As briefly as possible. I will not go into detail; I will
merely state that due to the collapse of 1918 and the unsatisfactory
conditions of the Versailles Treaty, Germany was faced with a severe
depression. The democratic parties, which had a firm hold on the
regime at that time, were not able to improve the situation; and the
other nations did not know what policy to take towards Germany.
I do not reproach any one; I merely state facts. Consequently, in
this state of depression, Hitler received a larger majority in the
Reichstag than had ever been the case since the formation of the
Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I ask the people who, although silent at the time, can tell
me now what I should have done; I ask them what they would have
done. I have stated that I was against a military regime, that I
wanted to avoid a civil war, and that, in keeping with democratic
principles, I saw only the one possibility: To allow the man to lead
the government once he had come to power. I said further that from
the moment I realized this I tried to participate in the government,
not with the intention of supporting this man in his extremist ideas,
but to act as a brake and, if possible, to direct his policies back into
normal channels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Then there came a time later when you recognized the
dangers, when you yourself suffered under the unbearable conditions
of terror and of suppressed opinion, so that perhaps this question is
pertinent and admissible: Why did you not emigrate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Had it been only a question of my personal fate,
nothing would have been simpler, especially since, as we have heard
before, I would have been offered that opportunity and it would
have been made easy for me. It was not merely a question of my
own welfare; but as I had devoted myself to the public interest since
1923, it was the question of the existence of my people, of my
country. I know of no instance in history where emigrants were of
help to their own nation. Of course, I speak of those emigrants who
leave of their own free will, not those that have been expelled. It
was not the case in 1792, at the time of the French Revolution; it
was not the case in 1917, during the Russian Revolution; and it was
not the case at the time of the National Socialist revolution which
<span class='pageno' title='557' id='Page_557'></span>
we witnessed. To sit in a safe harbor abroad and to write articles
which no one reads in the home country...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, we don’t want a historical lecture,
do we?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I believe we can stop here. He merely wanted to state
why he did not emigrate. [<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You have
been understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: In the course of these proceedings, either in a letter
or in a poem—I do not know which at the moment—there was
some mention of your thoughts on the possibility of dying a martyr’s
death; whether it would have served the cause of peace and
the German nation, if you had done more than you did; if you had
sacrificed your life...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think that you are referring to a quotation from
one of my notes, which a representative of the American Prosecution
read here, in which I spoke of the silence of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: If I had sacrificed myself, it would not have been
of the slightest use because the circumstances of my sacrifice would
never have become known. Either I would have disappeared in
some prison or I would have died there, and no one would have
known whether I was alive or not; or I would have been the victim
of a planned accident, and it would not have been possible to become
a martyr. Martyrs can be effective only if their martyrdom
becomes known to the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: May I ask for the attention of the Tribunal for a
moment? Yesterday I was denied a question concerning the social
attitude of the diplomatic corps and its influence on men like
Schacht, for instance. The question which I want to put now is not
the same question; otherwise I would not put it. But it has nevertheless...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The objection that I made was to the use of
the word “attitude,” because I don’t see how witnesses can give
evidence about the attitude of a corps. I said I think especially
that the fact that the diplomatic corps were present at the Party
rally might be given in evidence, but I said that the word “attitude”
was far too general. What is it you want to put now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yesterday, the question which I framed in the following
manner was denied: “How was Schacht influenced by the
collective attitude of the diplomatic corps?” That question was
denied, and that concludes the matter. Now, I should like first to
clarify the matter because I do not want to create the impression
<span class='pageno' title='558' id='Page_558'></span>
of smuggling into the proceedings a question which may raise the
same objections. On the one hand, it is essential for my line of
defense to show that people from abroad with judgment, who were
above being suspected of wanting to prepare for an aggressive war,
had the same attitude toward the regime as Schacht had. On the
other hand, it is one of the strong points of my defense to show that
the work of these people in their opposition was not only not supported
by foreign countries but was actually made more difficult.
That is the <span class='it'>thema probandum</span> that is important for me, and on this
theme—but please, Herr Schacht, do not answer before I have
received the permission of the Tribunal—this theme...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: State exactly what the question is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes, I will put the question now. According to my
notes I intended to refer to the tokens of honor, which the Nazi
regime received from abroad, and to the representatives and
numerous state visits paying honor to the regime, which have
already been mentioned here. I wanted to ask the defendant
what influence these frequent marks of great honor had on the
work and aims of this group of conspirators. However, since that
question is very similar to the one that has been rejected—and I
prefer to make my objections myself rather than to have them
made to me—I wanted to submit the question to the Tribunal first
and make sure that it is admissible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Dix, the question being: “What effect did
the recognition of the Nazi regime from abroad have upon the
group of conspirators with whom the Defendant Schacht was in
contact?” That is the question, is it not? Well, that question, as
the Tribunal thinks, you may put.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: It is admissible if “Anerkennung” is translated correctly
as “honor”—honor, not recognition in the sense of recognition
of a government in diplomatic official language, but honor,
respect. It is a difficulty of translation and I do not want a misunderstanding—may
I put to him, first, the individual official visits
which I have noted, so that he can answer the question? May I
do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, you may; actual visits?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes. The list will not be complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I remind you that in 1935, the delegate
of the Labor Party, Alan Hartwood...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks that you ought to put
the question in the general way in which I put it to you, and not
go into details of each visit or the details of each number of visits.
<span class='pageno' title='559' id='Page_559'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If Your Honor pleases, I want to
object to it as generalities, because it already appears that the
United States did not participate in this and I tried to keep the
European politics out of this case, and this is the entering wedge.
Now, I don’t want to get into this sort of thing. I think it is entirely
irrelevant that some foreigner, deceived by the appearance which
the Defendant Schacht was assisting in putting up, didn’t start a
war earlier. This thing is entirely irrelevant. The United States
has desired to keep this sort of thing out of this case because it
is endless if we go into it. It seems to me, if Herr Schacht wants
to put the responsibility for his conduct on some foreigner, that
foreigner should be named. He has already said that the United
States representatives, Mr. Messersmith and Mr. Dodd, had no part
in it because they were always against them. Now, it gets into a
situation here which seems to me impossible before this Tribunal,
and I cannot understand how it constitutes any defense for mitigation
for Schacht to show that the foreign powers maintained intercourse
with Germany even at a period of its degeneration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks the question is relevant
but should be put without detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: I will put the question without detail, and I would
like to say that I cannot, of course, speak of myself and America
in the same breath; but I, too, am trying to avoid foreign politics.
However, my question does not concern foreign politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Here is the one question: What
influence did the honors which were showered upon the Nazi regime
by foreign countries, in a manner well known to you, have on
the work of your group of conspirators?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Throughout the years from 1935, up to and including
1938, numerous statesmen from almost all other nations came to
Berlin to visit Hitler, including some crowned heads. From America,
for instance, there was Under Secretary of State Phillips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Do not mention any names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I said that only because names were expressly
mentioned here. It is not limited to Europe. I do not intend to
make any political explanations, I merely say that there were so
many visitors, which meant not only recognition but respect for
Hitler, that this man appeared a very great man in the eyes of
the German people. I still remember that in 1925, I believe, the
King of Afghanistan, Amanullah, appeared in Berlin. He was the
first foreigner to visit the Social Democratic Government, and there
was a celebration because at last a great man from another country
had visited us. In the case of Hitler, starting with 1935 there was
one visitor after another; and Hitler went from one foreign political
<span class='pageno' title='560' id='Page_560'></span>
success to another, which made it extremely difficult to enlighten
the German people and made it impossible to work for that
enlightenment within the German nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: And now, two final questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have heard the speech by the British Attorney General
Shawcross, who said that there should have been a point where
the servants of Hitler refused to follow him. We want to accept
that point of view, and I ask you: Do you believe that you yourself
acted in accord with that postulate of the leader of the British
Delegation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I not only accept it, but I fully approve of it. From
the very moment when I recognized what a harmful individual
Hitler was, what a threat to world peace, I broke with him, not
only secretly, but publicly and personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: So you consider that when you realized the truth
you did everything humanly possible to try and save humanity
from the disaster of this war and bring it to an end, once it had
started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I know of no one in Germany who would have
done more in that respect than I did. I warned against excessive
armament. I impeded, and if you like, sabotaged effective armament
through my economic policy. I resigned from the Ministry of
Economics against the will of Hitler; I publicly protested to Hitler
against all the abuses of the Party; I continuously warned people
abroad and gave them information; I attempted to influence the
policy of other nations with respect to the colonial question in
order to achieve a more peaceful atmosphere. Credits for continued
armaments...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think we have heard this more than once,
you know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I be permitted one sentence: I blocked Hitler’s
credits and I finally tried to remove him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. DIX: Gentlemen, I am now at the end of my presentation
of evidence for Schacht’s case, and I have only one request. During
the last few days, I have received a large number of letters and
also affidavits from well-known people who know Schacht. I will
examine them; and if I should decide that any of the affidavits
are relevant, I will get in touch with the Prosecution and discuss
with them whether they have any objection to having them translated,
so that we can perhaps submit them to the Tribunal—not
to have them read, but merely to have them put in evidence. May
I request that I be granted this right.
<span class='pageno' title='561' id='Page_561'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of my entire presentation, I will briefly submit my
documents; this has been only partially done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the other defendants’ counsel wish
to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I have only a few questions to
put to Dr. Schacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long have you known Herr Von Neurath, Dr. Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I cannot state the exact year, but at any rate for
a very long time; for many, many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: For some time, for about 4 years,
you were both colleagues as ministers in the government. During
that time, did you have any contact with him other than in purely
official capacity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Unfortunately not enough, but of course I saw him
from time to time. I would have liked to have seen him more often.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: But from conversations with him,
or from what you heard about him, you certainly formed an opinion
about his political views.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I was well acquainted with his views.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: And what was the trend of his
political thought?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I had the impression that basically Von Neurath
believed in a conservative policy, but was open to conviction where
progressive measures were concerned. He was above all in favor
of peaceful international co-operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you consider it possible, or do
you have any reason to believe, that under certain circumstances
he would also resort to belligerent methods or that he would even
consider them, if the peaceful understanding which he desired
was quite impossible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: According to my understanding of Neurath, I think
that he was entirely averse to any aggressive policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: You witnessed the various...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Lüdinghausen, will you kindly put the
earphones on, the Tribunal thinks these questions are not questions
which can properly be put because of their general nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did you have the impression that
in everything that he achieved, particularly in the occupation of
the Rhineland, Herr Von Neurath...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Lüdinghausen, this is not a proper question
to put to a witness, “Did you have an impression about him?”
<span class='pageno' title='562' id='Page_562'></span>
You can ask him what he said and what he did; what did Von
Neurath do and what did he say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes; then I will not put this question.
I have only one last question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You know that on the 4th of February
1938 Von Neurath resigned as Foreign Minister. What did
you and your immediate circle say to the resignation of Von Neurath
from foreign politics? What impression did it make upon you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I believe I have already said in the course of the
interrogation that I considered Von Neurath’s resignation a very
bad sign, for it meant departing from the previous policy of understanding
in foreign politics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Any other defendants’ counsel want to ask
questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution desire to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I think it might save time, Your
Honor, if we could take our recess at this time. It is a little early,
I know, but it takes some time to arrange our material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Dr. Schacht, according to the transcript
of the testimony at Page 8698 (Volume XII, Page 460), you said
that in 1938 you told a certain lady while you were dining: “My
dear lady, we have fallen into the hands of criminals. How could
I ever have suspected that!” You recall that testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It was not I who gave that testimony; it came from
an affidavit submitted here by my Defense Counsel, but it is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am sure you want to help the Tribunal
by telling us who those criminals were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Hitler and his confederates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you were there; you know who
the co-operators were. I am asking you to name all that you put
in that category of criminals with Hitler. Hitler, you know, is dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Mr. Justice, it is very difficult for me to answer that
question fully because I do not know who was in that close conspiracy
with Hitler. The Defendant Göring has told us here that
he considered himself one of that group. There were Himmler
and Bormann, but I do not know who else there was in the small
circle of men who were trusted by Hitler.
<span class='pageno' title='563' id='Page_563'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You have only named three men. Let
me put it this way: You named four men criminals, three of whom
are dead and one of them you say admitted...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I can add one more, if you will permit me. I assume
that the Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop was also always acquainted
with Hitler’s plans. I must assume that; I cannot prove it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Whom else did you include when you
were talking to the lady?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: On that evening I did not mention any names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But whom did you have in mind?
You surely were not making charges against your own people, who
were in charge of your own government, without having definite
names in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have taken the liberty of mentioning the names
to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Are those all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know, but I assume that there were more.
I would add without hesitation, Heydrich. But I cannot know with
whom...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Heydrich is a dead man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I regret that these people are dead, I would have
liked to see them die some other way; but...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, are those the only people that
you included?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have no proof of the fact that there was anyone
else in this conspiracy about whom I could say that there is proof
that he was a conspirator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, Dr. Schacht, at the time the
Nazis seized power you had a world-wide acquaintance and very
great standing as a leading banker in Germany and in the world,
did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know whether that is so, but if that is
your opinion I do not wish to contradict you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, at first you would admit that?
Wouldn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not contradict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And yet as we understand it, you
made public appearances in Germany before the German people
in support of the Nazi regime, alongside of characters such as
Streicher and Bormann.
<span class='pageno' title='564' id='Page_564'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Mr. Justice, I have taken the liberty of explaining
here that until July 1932 I did not in any way come forward publicly
for Hitler or the Party and that, on the contrary, in America for
instance, I warned the people against Hitler. At that time I—the
name Bormann was, of course, unknown to me at the time; and
Streicher’s paper, <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, was just as revolting to me before
that time as afterwards. I did not think that I had anything in
common with Herr Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I didn’t either, but that is why
I wondered about your appearing with him publicly before the
German people after 1933 when the Nazi regime was consolidating
its power. You did that, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: What did I do, Mr. Justice?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I spoke of your appearances, publicly,
before the German people with Streicher and Bormann in support
of the Nazi program after the seizure of power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not think so. I was never seen publicly with
Herr Streicher or with Mr. Bormann—certainly not at that time.
It is quite possible that he attended the same Party rallies as I,
or that I sat next to him; but, at any rate, in 1933 I was never
seen publicly either with Streicher or with Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask to have you shown the photograph
from the Hoffmann collection, marked Number 10. You have
no difficulty recognizing yourself in that, do you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And on the right sits Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And next to him the Minister of
Labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And on the other side of you is
Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And beyond him, Streicher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not recognize him; I do not know whether
it is Streicher, but perhaps it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I will offer the photograph in
evidence. And perhaps the identification will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And also Frick is in that picture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='565' id='Page_565'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: This becomes Exhibit Number
USA-829.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I will ask to have you shown...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Justice Jackson, what is the date of that
photograph?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There is no date given on the photographs.
Perhaps the defendant can tell us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Mr. Justice, you said that in 1933 I had permitted
myself to be seen publicly with Streicher and Bormann as a
representative of the National Socialist Party; and I should like
to know, therefore, where this picture was taken and when. I
cannot identify it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I asked you about after 1933. Schacht,
do you deny this is a photograph...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, no. By no means, I am merely asking when
it was taken. I do not think this refers to 1933 or 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When was it, if you want to tell us?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know; I cannot tell you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will show you another photograph—two
photographs, Numbers 3 and 4. Number 3 shows you marching
with Dr. Robert Ley among others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Number 4 shows you entering the
hall, marching, and giving the Nazi salute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Ley the man who suppressed
the labor unions of Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And those are correct photographs,
are they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I offer them in evidence under Exhibit
Number USA-829.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I will show you photographs marked
Numbers 1 and 2 and 6—and 7. Now let us look at Number 1.
Do you recall where that was taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes—one moment, if it is the number I have here—yes,
just a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Where was it taken?
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think Number 1 is a picture from the Reich Chancellery,
if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Among the persons appearing in
Number 1 is Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Gürtner, Goebbels, Popitz, Schacht, Papen, Göring,
and others, and Hitler in the middle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Neurath, do you recognize?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Neurath. Yes; I think he is immediately on Hitler’s
right, in the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Goebbels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I said Goebbels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You identify Funk as present in the
picture, at the extreme right, only a part of his body showing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Who is that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Funk, the Defendant Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, that is Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Back of Göring and back of Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I beg your pardon. Perhaps I have a different picture.
I beg your pardon. That is Number 2. On Number 2 I see
from left to right: Popitz, Rust, Göring, Neurath, Hitler, Blomberg,
Schacht, Gürtner, Krosigk, Eltz von Rübenach, and then at the very
back on the right, Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And let us take Number 7. Who do
you identify as your company in that photograph?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: On the extreme left, my late wife; then the Vice
President of the Reichsbank, Dreyse, Hitler, and myself. There
is an adjutant of Hitler, and the heavy-set man on the right—I do
not know who he is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a photograph taken when the foundation of the new
Reichsbank building was laid in 1934. Directly behind me, on the
right, is Blomberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And Number 6?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: One moment. That is the picture where I am walking
alongside Hitler, is that right? That is Hitler’s entrance in my
company, on the occasion when the foundation of the new Reichsbank
building was laid. Behind me, or rather behind Hitler, you
can see Geheimrat Vocke, who is to appear as a witness here
tomorrow, and several other gentlemen from the directorate of the
Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I offer the remaining photographs, 1,
6, and 7 in evidence under the same number.
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>So that it would appear, Dr. Schacht, that a good deal of your
present company was the company that started off with you in
1933 and 1934?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Is that a question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, is that not true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. If you had photographed me with my other
acquaintances just as often, the number would be 10 times as great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You testified—and I refer to Page 8650
of the record (Volume XII, Page 424)—that there were reasons of
principle why you did not become a Party member and that Party
membership would not be compatible with your principles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you also testified—I refer to
Page 8692 of the record (Volume XII, Page 455)—that from 1932 to
the 30th of January 1933—I am quoting you, “I have not written
or spoken a single word publicly for Hitler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think that is right, if you emphasize “publicly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You must emphasize “publicly”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I want yet to ask you about the next
thing. You also said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I have never helped in any way to exert influence in favor
of Hitler through discussions with any of the competent
gentlemen: Hindenburg, Meissner, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>; and I did not
participate in any way in the appointment of Hitler to
Reich Chancellor.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, are there any words that we
have to emphasize in that in order to understand it correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, in reference to Hitler’s becoming Chancellor,
please note I said, “competent men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I don’t just know what you
mean by that, but I’ll give you a chance to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. When I say “competent,” I mean those people
who could decide as to who was to be Chancellor. Of course, I
did say that Hitler would be Chancellor and must become Chancellor,
and I expressed those convictions in private circles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you say that in public?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, I said that only in a circle of my friends,
business acquaintances, and such like.
<span class='pageno' title='568' id='Page_568'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I want to quote you a statement
by Von Papen:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When I was Chancellor of Germany, in 1932, Schacht came
to see me in July or August while I was at home. He said,
‘here’s a very intelligent man.’—It was in the presence of
my wife and I have never forgotten it.—He said, ‘Give him
your position. Give it to Hitler. He is the only man who
can save Germany.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you say that or didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know whether I said that he was the only
man who could save Germany, but I did tell him that Hitler would
and must become Chancellor. But that was in August or July of
1932, after the July elections; and it has nothing to do with Hitler’s
nomination, which did not take place until after the Schleicher
Cabinet, about which I have been examined here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, Dr. Schacht, I just asked you
if you had not testified that you had nothing to do with his coming
to the Chancellorship and you said...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: ...and it is here said that you asked
Von Papen to give the place to him and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: ...and do you contend—and I want
you to say anything you want to about this—do you contend that
that was not aiding Hitler to the Chancellorship?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know whether it was aiding Hitler. In
the course of my examination here, I have been asked whether I
had exerted any influence in connection with Hitler’s election or
his nomination for the Chancellorship in January 1933. I have
given the names of Hindenburg, Meissner, and so forth, that is
to say, Hindenburg’s circle. Since the beginning of November 1932,
Papen was no longer Chancellor and thus he had no influence upon
these matters at all. I did not talk to Papen at all during those
weeks. On the contrary, after the elections of 1932, I said that
it was inevitable that a man who had obtained so many votes in
the Reichstag must take over the political lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now let me get you correctly. When
you saw Hitler was going to win you joined him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I’ll just make it clear what
you do mean. You did not assist him until he had already accumulated
more votes than any other Party in the Reichstag?
<span class='pageno' title='569' id='Page_569'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not join Hitler when I saw that he would
win, but when I had discovered that he had won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Oh, well, I’ll accept the amendment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have referred to your letter to Hitler on the 29th of
August 1932...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: ...in which you advised him not to
put forward any detailed economic program?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You told him there was no such
program on which 14 millions could agree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that economic policy is not a
factor for building up a party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you added that, “You can always
count on me as your reliable assistant”; did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then that was after he had won?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And then on the 12th of...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, I just want to refer to that document
as EC-456, Exhibit Number USA-773. Now, then, on the
12th of November 1932, you wrote a letter to him, in which you
said, among other things, “I have no doubt that the present development
of things can only lead to your becoming Chancellor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “It seems as if our attempt to collect
a number of signatures from business circles for this purpose is
not altogether in vain...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were collecting signatures for
this purpose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not I, but I participated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were assisting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that was Document Number
EC-456.
<span class='pageno' title='570' id='Page_570'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as of November 1932, a document was prepared for a
large number of industrialists to sign, urging the selection of Hitler
as Chancellor, in substance, was there not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I no longer remember the document, but I assume
that that is the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And men like Schacht, Schröder, and
Krupp, and a great number of industrialists signed that document,
did they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is possible, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it was sent to Von Hindenburg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, the purpose of it was to aid
Hitler in obtaining the Chancellorship?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: It is addressed to the Reich President,
is it not? Document Number 3901-PS, Exhibit Number USA-837.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have not seen it; but it is probably correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you do not deny that that
occurred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I assume that it is correct. I have not seen it, but
I do not doubt it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, in November of 1932 you communicated
to Hitler the result of your money-raising campaign, did
you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know anything about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I’ll remind you from your own
interrogation. Well, I’ll remind you first, of your testimony, in
which you say that it appears that you did not plead for funds but
that Göring pleaded for funds; and I ask if you did not, on the
9th of October 1945, give these answers to these questions as to
events of February 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Events of what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Events of February 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Going back to 1933. This is the
question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Prior to the time that Hitler appointed you as President
of the Reichsbank, do you recall a meeting in the home of
Göring?
<span class='pageno' title='571' id='Page_571'></span></p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes. That was a financial meeting. I have been
interrogated about that several times already.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Tell me about it.’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes, I will. Hitler had to go to the elections on
5 March, if you will remember, and for these elections he
wanted money for the campaign. He asked me to procure the
money and I did. Göring called these men together and I made
a speech—not a speech, for Hitler made the speech—then I
asked them to write down the amounts and to subscribe for
the elections, which they did. They subscribed a total of
3 millions and they allocated the sum among themselves.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Who were the people who made up that subscription
list?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I think that all of them were bankers and industrialists.
They represented the chemical industry, iron industry,
textile industry, all of them.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Representatives of all the industries?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘All of them; all of the big industries.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Do you recall any of their names?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Oh certainly; Krupp was there—the old gentleman,
Gustav. He arose from his seat and thanked Hitler and was
very enthusiastic about him at the time. And then there was
Schnitzler—I think it was he—and Vögler for the United Steel
Works.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you give that testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, at that meeting you have referred
to Document Number D-203, which is a record of the meeting—at
that meeting Göring said this in substance, did he not?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The sacrifices which are required would be so much easier
for industry to bear if it knew that the election of 5 March
would surely be the last one for the next 10 years, probably
even for the next 100 years.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You heard that, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now yesterday or the day before you
were interrogated about your support and about the tribute that
Goebbels paid to you; and you said to the Court, “It is not my fault
if Goebbels made a mistake.” Do you recall that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I ask you, if testifying about
Dr. Goebbels you did not say this to the interrogator of the United
<span class='pageno' title='572' id='Page_572'></span>
States, on the 17th day of October 1945, Exhibit Number USA-616
(Document Number 3729-PS)?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question: ‘When did you become interested in becoming a
co-worker of Hitler?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I should say in the years of 1931, 1932.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And that was when you saw that he had a mass
movement that was likely to take power?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Quite right; it was growing continually.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And did you publicly record your support for
Hitler in those years?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I think I made a statement in December 1930 once
at the Bavarian People’s Party, upon coming back from
America. I said that there was a choice for any future
Government, either to hold against 25 percent socialists, or
against 20 percent National Socialists.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘But what I mean—to make it very brief indeed—did
you lend the prestige of your name to help Hitler come
to power?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I stated publicly that I expected Hitler to come
into power for the first time that I remember in November
1932.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And you know, or perhaps you don’t, that Goebbels
in his diary, records with great affection...’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘...the help that you gave him at that time?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes, I know that.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘November 1932?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘You say the book is called <span class='it'>From the Kaiserhof
to the Reich Chancellery</span>?’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘That’s right; you have read that?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And you don’t deny that Goebbels was right?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I think his impression was that he was correct at
that time.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you give that testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I never doubted that Goebbels was under this
impression; I merely said that he was mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then you didn’t—Well, I won’t
bother. Now, you made some extensive quotations from Ambassador
Dodd yesterday, the day before. Did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='573' id='Page_573'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And let’s have this understood: Ambassador
Dodd was consistently and at all times opposed to the
entire Nazi outfit, wasn’t he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: So you got no encouragement from
him to be in this outfit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh, no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you testified, as I understood
you, that Ambassador Dodd invited you to go to the United States
of America and you say—I am quoting from Page 8670 of the record
(Volume XII, Page 439):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At that time, 1937, he called on me and urged me to go with
him, or follow him as soon as possible, and change my residence
to America. He said that I would find a very pleasant
welcome in America. I believe he never would have said that
to me if he had not had a friendly feeling towards me.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You said that to the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And I think you intended to convey
to the Tribunal the impression that Ambassador Dodd had great
confidence in you and great friendship for you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I had that impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Have you read his entire diary, or did
you confine yourself to reading extracts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I also know of the passage where he said, “You
would make a very bad American,” or something like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, yes, you didn’t mention that to
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think that would be better for the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, we are not disappointing you
then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are you not familiar with his entry under the date of December
21, 1937, where he speaks of the luncheon at which you were
present?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Schacht spoke of the defeat of Germany in 1918 as wholly
due to Woodrow Wilson’s bringing America into the World
War. But I said Wilson’s Fourteen Points were the one great
promise of international peace and co-operation, and every
country on both sides had helped to defeat his purpose. Don’t
you think Wilson, 50 years from now, will be regarded as one
of the greatest presidents the United States has ever had? He
<span class='pageno' title='574' id='Page_574'></span>
evaded an answer but turned his attention to the Japanese-Chinese
war and opposed Germany’s alliance to Japan. Then
he showed the true German attitude, quoting, ‘If the United
States would stop the Japanese War and leave Germany to
have her way in Europe, we would have world peace.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: What is the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you make those statements?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know whether I said it, but even today it
seems an extremely reasonable statement. I am of the opinion that
it was correct with one exception, I believe...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, now let’s get this straight. As
I understand you correctly, you can have peace, world peace, if Germany
was left to have her way in Europe?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. May I say that there were various opinions
about the path Germany was to take; mine was a peaceful one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, he goes on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I did not comment, and others also failed to make remarks.
Schacht meant what the Army Chiefs of 1914 meant when
they invaded Belgium, expecting to conquer France in 6 weeks,
namely; domination and annexation of neighboring little countries,
especially north and east.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Am I to reply?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you say that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Was that what Dodd said about your
conversation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: But I did not say that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, may I...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What was the impression?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, may I answer please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I ask you this question: What is the
impression received over the course of his acquaintance with you
by a man whom you describe as being a decent fellow and a friend
of yours?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I answer that I have already stated that Mr. Dodd
was the victim of many misconceptions. In this case, too, he does
not say that I said it; he says, “Schacht meant.” That was his opinion
which he attributed to me. I never said that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I so understood it; but it was the estimate
of a friendly observer, I take it from you.
<span class='pageno' title='575' id='Page_575'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: A friendly observer who continually misunderstood;
Ambassador Henderson has proved that in his book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: He may have misunderstood Henderson;
but there is never any doubt that he understood the Nazi danger
from the beginning, is there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes; but he misunderstood my attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, when you went and asked first
the Foreign Minister and then Hitler to go to the United States, or
have some one go to the United States, you testified, on Page 8708
of the record (Volume XII, Page 467) that you told Hitler this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It seems vital to me that there should be someone constantly
in America who could clarify German interests publicly, in
the press, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you say that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, is that what you actually said
to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I call your attention to your
own letter, Document Number 3700-PS to the Reich Marshal.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the beginning of 1940 I proposed to the Führer that I
should go to the United States in order to attempt to slow
down America’s assistance to England in the matter of
armaments and, if possible, to prevent America becoming
involved more deeply in the war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask you, which of those is true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Both of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Both? Then you did not reveal to the
Tribunal yesterday, when you reported the conversation, all that
you had pretended that you would do in the United States, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, certainly not. I wanted, for instance, to try to
persuade the President to intervene for peace. That, too, I did not
mention here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you also testified yesterday that
you were never told about the extent, the type, and the speed of
rearmament. Do you recall that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But although you had no such information,
you said it was too much?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I had the feeling that one ought to go slowly.
<span class='pageno' title='576' id='Page_576'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, let me remind you of certain
statements made by General Von Blomberg concerning 1937.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Answer: ‘At that time, the organization of the planned
Wehrmacht was about complete.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘When? 1937?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I believe it was 1937.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Was that a plan that had been discussed with
Doctor Schacht in connection with the financing, as to how
big the Wehrmacht would be?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes. Schacht knew the plan for the formation of
the Wehrmacht very well, since we informed him every year
about the creation of new formations for which we had been
expending money. I remember that, in the year 1937 we
discussed what the Wehrmacht would need for current
expenses after a large amount had been spent for creating
it.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘That means that you gave Schacht a clear statement
of how much money each year went into the creation
of new units, new installations, and so forth, and how
much you were using for the operating expenses of the
Wehrmacht?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Exactly right.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘When you say that by 1937 the plan had been
fulfilled, do you mean in the main?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘In the main.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another question. I skip two or three irrelevant ones.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When you say that Schacht was familiar with those figures,
how were they brought to his attention?</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘The demands for the money needed were handed
to Schacht in writing.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘That means that in connection with the money
which Schacht was raising for the rearmament program, he
was informed of how many divisions and how many tanks
and so forth would be procured through these means?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I don’t think we put down the amount of money
we would need for every tank and so forth, but we would
put down how much every branch of the Wehrmacht, like
the Navy or Air Force, needed, and then we would state
how much was required for activating and how much for
operating.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘That is, Doctor Schacht could see each year how
much of an increase there would be in the size of the Armed
Forces as a result of the money he was procuring?’
<span class='pageno' title='577' id='Page_577'></span></p>

<p>“Answer: ‘That is certain.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I ask whether you deny the statements made by Von Blomberg
as I have put them to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, unfortunately, I must say that I know nothing
about this. A member of the Reichsbank Directorate, Geheimrat
Vocke, will testify tomorrow; and I ask that you put this matter
to him so that the question will be clarified. The question was
not one of informing me, but of informing the Reichsbank Directorate.
Everything that I knew the Reichsbank Directorate naturally
also knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Dr. Schacht, I don’t care whether you
know or didn’t know as far as the Prosecution’s case is concerned.
What I am asking you these questions for is to know how far we
can rely on your testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: So there will be no misunderstanding
about that. And you deny that Von Blomberg was telling the
truth when he says, when he reported to you in writing, those
facts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, unfortunately I must deny it. Evidently he
does not remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you testified yesterday or the
day before, that the so-called New Plan had nothing to do with the
armament program, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Nothing in particular with armament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Oh, nothing in particular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. I mean of course—the Tribunal was expressly
asked whether I was to speak about the New Plan here or not, and
the Tribunal decided that it was to be brought up at your cross-examination.
I am prepared to inform you now about the New
Plan before you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, Dr. Schacht, you have no objection
to answering my questions, have you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Certainly not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am referring to the answer which
you gave—the one which you were not allowed to give—find the
Page 8732 of this record (Volume XII, Pages 484 and 485):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question: ‘Some of your economic policies during the time
you were Minister of Economics, which have been accused
as being in preparation for war, were the so-called New Plan.
What was that?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='578' id='Page_578'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>And your answer:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“May I state first of all that the New Plan had nothing at all
to do with rearmament.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then you went into an explanation of the New Plan which
the Court did not receive, and I am asking you only this question:
Did you not say, in your speech on the Miracle of Finance on the
29th day of November 1938, this—after quoting a great number of
figures: “These figures show how much the New Plan contributed
to the execution of the armament program as well as to the securing
of our food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you say that or didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is Document Number EC-611,
Exhibit Number USA-622.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I understood you to say in your testimony that you really
didn’t have anything to do socially with Hitler or with the other
Nazis and that you refused their invitation to lunch at the Reich
Chancellery; and one of the chief reasons was that those present
showed such abject humility to Hitler. Did you say that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I want to read to you from
your speech, Document Number EC-501, your inaugural speech on
the occasion of the Führer’s birthday. This was a public speech,
by the way, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know. I do not remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You made a speech on the Führer’s
birthday on the 21st of April 1937, carried in the newspapers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Maybe.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “We are meeting together here
to remember with respect and love the man to whom the
German people entrusted the control of its destiny more than
4 years ago.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then, after some other remarks, you say,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“With the limitless passion of a glowing heart and the infallible
instinct of a born statesman, Adolf Hitler, in a struggle
which he led for 14 years with calm logic, has won for himself
the soul of the German people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Was that a part of your published and public speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I assume that you have quoted it quite correctly.
I do not believe that anyone, on the occasion of the birthday celebration
of the head of a state, could say anything very different.
<span class='pageno' title='579' id='Page_579'></span>
Mr. Justice, may I make one request. You have completely passed
over the New Plan, while the Tribunal has pointed out that it was
to be discussed here in cross-examination. If you are not going to
refer to the New Plan, may I ask that the New Plan be discussed
again in re-examination by my attorney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I did not ask you what the New Plan
was; I asked whether your statement that it had nothing to do
with armaments was true or not. But if your solicitor wants to
ask about it, it is open to ruling by the Tribunal. You quoted
today Hitler’s letter of the 19th of January 1939, in which you were
dismissed from the presidency of the Reichsbank; and you did not
quote the concluding sentence, as I recall it, which reads, “I am
happy to be able to avail myself of your services for the solution
of new tasks in your position as Reich Minister.” That is a correct
quotation, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I refer to the testimony by the witness Gisevius,
who has already said that outwardly Hitler would never indicate
that there was dissension between himself and his collaborators but
that he always attempted to give a false impression to the world.
After January 1939 Hitler never asked for my opinion or my co-operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Were you asked by anyone else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. I cited this morning the occasions when I was
asked for assistance. That was in connection with Belgium, and
in connection with the periodical, <span class='it'>Das Reich</span>. I think that was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you performed no functions
whatever in reference to Belgium?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I quote your letter of the 17th
of October 1940 to the Reich Minister of Economics, Document
EC-504, USA-830. At that time you had ceased to be President of
the Reichsbank, had you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I was only a minister without portfolio.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “So that the German banks in the
occupied western territories need not work side-by-side, or
rather against each other, you had assigned the Deutsche
Bank the task of clearing the way for closer economic co-operation
with Holland; and you entrusted the Dresdner Bank
with the same task for Belgium.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And you go on to describe that situation and say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In order to remove this difficulty, you, Herr Reich Minister,
have agreed that the undersigned comply with the requests of
both banking houses for a decisive expression of opinion in
<span class='pageno' title='580' id='Page_580'></span>
this question. I have subsequently discussed the situation
with both banks and it was confirmed in the course of the
conversation that at present there is no tendency on the
part of Dutch or Belgian financial institutions to enter into
general ties with the German business men.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you recall?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I remember it, now that you have read it to
me. May I make a statement, or what was your question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I just wondered if you remembered
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, and I ask permission to make a statement. It
concerns...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: If you think it needs explaining...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I would think so; but I leave that to the Tribunal.
If I may speak: It concerns a rivalry between two large banks.
Both these large banks approached me—as a former banker and
President of the Reichsbank—to decide the matter, and I did. I
really do not see what that has to do with the official participation
in the Belgian administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the purpose of your intervention
was to avoid misunderstanding in the occupied countries between
the banking interests of the occupied countries and the German
banks, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Certainly, they were to work together peacefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. Although you have said to the
Tribunal that you were entirely opposed to the Germans being
in there at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Of course. But now that they were there I tried
to keep peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You also were approached by Krupp
von Bohlen about raising a fund known as the “Hitler spending
fund,” were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You never were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Never.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, that is most unfortunate—that
your name should be connected with...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I know the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You never received such a letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I know the letter, but I was not assigned the
task of raising that fund.
<span class='pageno' title='581' id='Page_581'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you assisted in raising it,
didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you contribute to it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I personally, certainly not. I do not know what
you are accusing me of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I thought you knew about the letter
from Von Bohlen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, but I ask you of what are you accusing me?
Please tell me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did you raise any money or help to
organize a loan with Krupp von Bohlen in May of 1933—the Hitler
spending fund?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: How did you answer Krupp von
Bohlen’s letter asking you to do so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Would you please remind me of what Herr Von
Krupp wrote to me at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Have you the letter of the 29th
of May?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, one moment, please, I have nearly finished.
May I reply now? From this...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: First of all, did you receive such a
letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right. Tell us what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In that letter Herr Von Krupp informed me that
industry and other economic circles, such as agriculture, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>,
intended to organize a joint Hitler fund in order to combine in
one collection the unrestrained Party collections which were making
the entire country insecure. He informed me of this, and also of
the fact that a board of trustees was to be appointed for this Hitler
fund. I want to say that I never joined the board of trustees and
was not a member of it. He further informed me that the representatives
of the banks, Dr. Fischer and Dr. Mosier, would contact me
and inform me about these things. That is all that the letter says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That I offer as Exhibit Number
USA-831, (Document Number D-151).</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Will you look at the following letter
of the 30th of May 1933, which says they had the opportunity of
mentioning it to you?
<span class='pageno' title='582' id='Page_582'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: One moment, please. I do not think the letter is in
my document book. No, it is not here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was handed to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I asked you to read the letter of the
29th of May first; one of the 29th of May and one of the 30th. The
29th of May has not been translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I see. Just a minute. I read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This letter never reached me. It has been crossed out and
apparently it was not sent, because Krupp and I had a personal
conversation to which Krupp refers in the letter of the following
day, 30 May; the letter begins, “As Dr. Köttgen and I had the
opportunity of mentioning to you yesterday...” That apparently
was a personal conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, and you had also said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“You were kind enough to promise me to obtain from Messrs.
Otto Christian Fischer and Dr. Mosier...full particulars,
and especially information on how far banks which are public
corporations can participate in this task.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, Mr. Justice Jackson, it does not say that in
the letter. Please, will you be good enough to read the letter of
29 May? Where does it say that I spoke to Dr. Fischer or would
speak to Dr. Mosier?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you deny receiving the letter of
the 29th?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You never received it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Do you deny having a conversation
with Krupp von Bohlen-Halbach, the substance of which is set
forth in that letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No—One moment. Please, let me answer quietly.
I do not wish to be accused of anything without replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not receive that letter on 29 May, nor did I receive it later.
Instead, there was a personal conversation. The subject of that
conversation is contained in the letter of 30 May, which we read
before and which I received. You have just asserted that I had
promised Krupp von Bohlen to speak to Dr. Fischer and Dr. Mosier.
The letter makes no mention of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Does it not say so in the memorandum
which you say was replaced by a conversation? That is what I
am trying to ask you.
<span class='pageno' title='583' id='Page_583'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: At any rate, I did not promise to talk to the
gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Anything more you want to say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. That is enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, yesterday, I think it was, you
testified that you had made public statements against the terror
policy of the regime; and in evidence you quoted from your Königsberg
speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Unfortunately, Dr. Schacht, you
stopped just at the point where I got interested in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, that is generally the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: After you had stated that there are
people who ran Germany—let me quote the part you quoted, because
it is important in connection...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Quote the whole thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. This is what you quoted:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Those are the people who heroically smear window panes in
the middle of the night; who brand every German who trades
in a Jewish store as a traitor; who condemn every former
Freemason as a scoundrel, and who, in the just fight against
priests and ministers who talk politics from the pulpit, cannot
themselves distinguish between religion and misuse of
the pulpit. The goal at which these people aim is generally
correct and good.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is what you quoted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now let us go on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The goal at which these people aim is generally correct and
good. There is no place in the Third Reich for secret societies,
regardless of how harmless they are. The priests and ministers
should take care of souls, and not meddle in politics. The
Jews must realize that their influence is gone for all time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was also a part of that speech, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you pointed out in that speech
that on the Jewish problem, as you called it, legislation is being
prepared and must be awaited?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I had hoped so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You assured them so, did you not?
<span class='pageno' title='584' id='Page_584'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I beg your pardon? Yes, that was the intention as
I gathered from my conversation with Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you knew that the laws on the
Jewish subject were on their way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not the laws which were passed later. I always
urged Hitler to give legal protection to the Jews. I wanted to see
this law enacted, and I assumed that it would be done; but instead
the Racial Laws of September or November, yes, November, 1935,
were passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I have quoted from Exhibit Number
USA-832, which is Document EC-433, and you say the laws you
were forecasting and promising were laws for the protection of the
Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We will get to that later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You gave your reasons, which you said were reasons of principle,
to the Tribunal for not becoming a Party member?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR: JUSTICE JACKSON: Yesterday in Court, do you recall
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now isn’t it a fact that you have told
the United States Prosecution Staff that you asked Hitler whether
to join the Party, and that to your great relief Hitler told you
not to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. Before I co-operated with him I wanted to find
out whether he demanded that I should become a member of the
Party. I was most relieved when he said I need not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: So you remained out of the Party
with Hitler’s consent and approval?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, of course. I think that is just another reason
which will prove that I have never been a member of the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But you did not mention that to the
Tribunal when you were giving your reasons for setting out, that
Hitler had given permission?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, I thought the Tribunal would believe me
anyway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When you received the Party golden
swastika, you stated that it was the greatest honor that could be
conferred by the Third Reich, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did, yes.
<span class='pageno' title='585' id='Page_585'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And while you didn’t wear it in your
daily life, you did wear it on official occasions, you stated, did
you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. It was very convenient on railroad journeys,
when ordering a car, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: From 1933 to 1942 you contributed
a thousand Reichsmark a year to the Nazi Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. Yes, I beg your pardon; from 1937 to 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Didn’t you say on interrogation that
it was from 1933 to 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, that is an error. From 1937, after I had received
the swastika. Evidently that is a misunderstanding. After I had
received it I said to myself, “It would be fitting—give the people
a thousand marks a year, and have done with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: For upwards of ten years, not quite
ten years, you accepted and held office of one kind or another
under this regime, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: From 17 March 1933 to 21 January 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And as I understand you, that during
this time, at least a part of the time, Hitler deceived you, and all
the time you deceived Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, oh no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I have misunderstood you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well now...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I believe that in the first years, at least, I did not
deceive Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I not only believe so, I know it. I only started to deceive him
in 1938. Until then, I always told him my honest opinion. I did
not cheat him at all; on the contrary...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What becomes, then, of your explanation
that you entered his government in order to put brakes on
his program? Did you tell him that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh, no. I should hardly have done that or he
would never have admitted me into the government. But I did
not deceive him about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did he know your purpose in joining
his government was to defeat his program by sabotage?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not say that I wanted to defeat his program.
I said that I wanted to direct it into orderly channels.
<span class='pageno' title='586' id='Page_586'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, you have said that you wanted
to put brakes on it. You used that expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Which meant slow down? Didn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And he wanted to speed it up, isn’t
that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You never allowed him to know that
you had entered his government for the purpose of slowing down
his rearmament program, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It was not necessary to tell him what I was thinking.
I did not deceive him. I made no false statements, but I would
hardly tell him what I actually thought and wanted. He did not
tell me his innermost thoughts either, and you do not tell them
to your political opponents either. I never deceived Hitler except
after 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I daresay. I am not asking you about
a political opponent. I am asking you about the man in whose
government you entered and became a part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You don’t tell your opponents; but is
it customary in Germany that members of the government enter
for the purpose of defeating the head of the government’s program?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have already told you that the word defeat is
incorrect. I did not intend to defeat him. I intended to slow him
down; and that is indeed the custom, for that is how every coalition
government is constructed. If you enter into a coalition government,
you must discuss certain matters with your neighboring parties
and come to an agreement about them, and you must use your
influence to check certain projects of the other party. That is not
a deception; it is an attempt at a compromise solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You claim you entered as a coalition?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I explained that in a distinct and comprehensive
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You used the word yourself today,
in describing your activities, as sabotaging his rearmament program,
did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I did so, shall we say, after 1936. But he
noticed it. That was not a deception.
<span class='pageno' title='587' id='Page_587'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You take some part of the responsibility,
I take it, for the loss of the war by Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is a very strange question. Please, forgive me
if I say that I assume no responsibility. Since I am not responsible
for the fact that the war started I cannot assume any responsibility
for the fact that it was lost. I did not want war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And when did your doubts about
Hitler as a man, his integrity, first arise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have explained that in such detail during the
examination that I do not think I need repeat it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Did that occur—I’ll put it in the
terms of your interrogation, since your interrogation is a little
clearer.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In 1934”—so your interrogation runs—“he killed many
people without having any legal justification or had them
killed; and a few days after, in the Reichstag, he said he
was the highest judge in Germany. He was certainly not,
and for the first time I was shaken by his conception. It
seemed to me absolutely immoral and inhuman.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I said that here yesterday or the day before; exactly
the same thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I want to fix these dates,
Dr. Schacht. You see, your purpose in this trial and mine aren’t
exactly the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, no, I know that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you also received full information
about the operation of the Gestapo from Gisevius in 1934
or 1935, as he testified, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, he did not say that. He said that he knew
about these matters. He did not tell me everything, but I admitted
earlier today—this morning—that he did inform me of certain
things, and from that I drew my conclusions. At the beginning of
May 1935 I had already discussed this matter with Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were informed about the Gestapo
terrorism, Reichstag Fire...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The Reichstag Fire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: ...the falsity of the purge claim...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: One moment, please. May I take them in order?
I was not told about the Reichstag Fire until years later by the
late Count Helldorf, who has been mentioned by Gisevius.
<span class='pageno' title='588' id='Page_588'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You mean Gisevius never told you
about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think I heard it from Helldorf. I may have heard
it from Gisevius, but I think it was Helldorf. At any rate, it was
after 1935 that I heard about it. Until then, I did not think it was
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You never doubted Gisevius’ word
when he told you in 1934 or 1935 as he testified, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: One moment. He told me this either in 1934 or
1935, but not 1934 and 1935, and if he did tell me—well if Gisevius
said so, I assume that it is true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: It was then that you knew about the
persecution of the churches and the destruction of the labor unions,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The destruction of the labor unions took place as
early as May 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You knew all about that, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did not know everything, only what was generally
known. I knew exactly what every other German knew about it
and what the labor unions themselves knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: As a matter of fact, that was one
of the reasons for the contributions by yourself and other industrialists
to the Nazi Party, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh, no: oh, no. There was never any question of
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You mean that meetings of industrialists
were held, and as important a thing to industry as the
destruction of the labor unions was never mentioned in your conferences?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I know nothing about it. Will you please remind
me of something definite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Confiscation of the properties; the
putting of labor union leaders into concentration camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I heard about that—one moment. I do not know
exactly who was put into the concentration camps. I was
informed about the confiscation of property because that was
publicly announced; but, if I understand you correctly, I do not
know what the meetings of industrialists had to do with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you also knew very early about
the persecution of the Jews, didn’t you?
<span class='pageno' title='589' id='Page_589'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I explained yesterday exactly what I knew about
the persecution of the Jews, how I acted in connection with the
persecution of the Jews, and I state that as long as I was a minister
I did everything to prevent these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I understood your generality, and I
am trying to get at a little more detail about it, Dr. Schacht.
Did you not testify as follows, on your interrogation on the 17th
of October 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The National Socialists, as I understood from the program,
intended to have a smaller percentage of Jews in the governmental
and cultural positions of Germany, with which I
agreed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “Question: ‘Well, now, you had
read <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, had you not?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And you knew the views of Hitler on the Jewish
question. Did you not?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You so testified, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “Question: ‘Well, now, during
your time as Reich Minister, statutes were passed, were they
not, prohibiting all Jewish lawyers, for example, from practicing
in the courts?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes, that is what I said.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Did you agree with that?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you say that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you did agree with excluding...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I always agreed with that principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. And you also agreed with the
principle of excluding all Jews from civil service positions, did
you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. I want to emphasize in this connection...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: May I finish?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='590' id='Page_590'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: With regard to the principle of the dominating
Jewish influence in government, legal, and cultural questions I have
always said that I did not consider this influence to be of advantage
either to the German people and Germany, which was a Christian
state and based on Christian conceptions, or to the Jews, since it
increased the animosity against them. For these reasons I was
always in favor of limiting Jewish participation in those fields, not
actually according to the population, but nevertheless limiting them
to a certain percentage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, let’s go on with the interrogation.
The interrogations are always so much briefer than the
answers made in court where the press is present, if I may say so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you not give these answers:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question: ‘Now, with respect to civil service. There was
this Aryan clause that was put in. Did you agree with that
legislation?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘With the same limitation.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Now, did you ever express yourself in the Cabinet
or elsewhere to the point that you wanted these restrictions
put in, restrictions you have been talking about?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I don’t think so; useless to do it.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘You say “useless to do it?” ’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘I thought you said at one time or another that
the reason you stayed in is because you thought you might
have some influence on policy.’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘You didn’t consider this as important enough a
matter to take a position on it?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Not an important enough matter to risk a break.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: To break, that is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, you were asked this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“You certainly signed a law with respect to the prohibition
of Jews receiving licenses to deal in foreign currencies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “Answer: ‘Yes, maybe.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘You were in favor of that?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I don’t remember the details of that question.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Well, it is not a matter of details. The question is
a matter of discrimination.’
<span class='pageno' title='591' id='Page_591'></span></p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You said that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were in favor of that legislation,
or were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Is that the question now, or from the interrogation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am asking you now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I agreed to it. Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were in favor of it. Well, you
were not when you were interrogated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: You can see how difficult it is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The question then was, you were in
favor of it, and you said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“ ‘I wasn’t in favor, but I had to sign it.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘Well, you were the only one who signed it. You
were the Reich Minister of Economics?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And, obviously, it was a bill which was put in
by your Ministry, was it not?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I assume so. You see, in these matters it was
a question of degrees. I have just explained the principles of my
policy. The extent to which these individual laws went is a question
of politics. Today, you can say what you like about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, you also favored the law, and
signed the law, prohibiting all Jews from being admitted to examinations
for public economic advisors, for co-operatives, for example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, possibly. I do not remember but probably it is
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you also approved a law imposing
the death penalty on German subjects who transferred German
property abroad, or left German property abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And of course you knew that that
affected, chiefly and most seriously, the Jews who were moving
abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I hope that the Jews did not cheat any more than
the Christians.
<span class='pageno' title='592' id='Page_592'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, the death penalty on German
subjects for transferring German property abroad was your idea of
a just law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not understand. My idea?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: It was an idea of the Minister of Finance, and I
signed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, the question was then asked
you after these were recited:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Well, now, was there a matter of conscience involved, or
was there not?”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And you answered:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“To some extent, yes, but not important enough to risk a
break.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And the question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Yes. In other words, you had quite another objective which
was more important?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “Well what was that objective,
Dr. Schacht?” I am still reading. It saves time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh, pardon me.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “Answer: ‘Well, the objective was
to stay in power and to help carry this through in an ordinary
and reasonable way.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘That is to say, the restoration of the German
economy?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Quite.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And the completion of the armament program?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘The completion of the international equality, the
political equality of Germany.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘By means of armament, as you yourself have
said?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Also by means of armament.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: All correct, and I stand by that today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes. So the armament question was
so important that you didn’t want to risk any break about the
Jews.
<span class='pageno' title='593' id='Page_593'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not the armament question, but the equality of
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, now, I just asked you “by
means of armament, as you yourself have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: And I say, also by means of armament. That is one
of the means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And it is the only one that was used
ultimately, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, it was not. There were other ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: We will get to that in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, isn’t it a fact that you also approved the law dismissing
all Jewish officials and notaries public?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you wrote to Blomberg on the
24th of December 1935 giving your motives, did you not, saying
this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The economic and illegal treatment of the Jews, the anti-Church
movement of certain Party organizations, and the
lawlessness which centers in the Gestapo are a detriment to
our rearmament task which could be considerably lessened
through the application of more respectable methods,
without abandoning the goals in the least.” (Exhibit Number
Schacht-13).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You wrote that, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. I quoted it myself yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, as to the rearmament program,
you participated in that from three separate offices, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I do not know which offices you mean, but please
go ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I will help you to list them. In the
first place, you were Plenipotentiary for War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That was the secret office at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were President of the Reichsbank.
That was the financial office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you were Minister of Economics,
in which position you had control with the minister for the general
economic situation.
<span class='pageno' title='594' id='Page_594'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes. This word “control” is such a general term
that I cannot confirm your statement without question, but I was
Minister of Economics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, let us take up first this position
of Plenipotentiary for War. You have testified that this position
was created for two purposes: (a) Preparation for war; (b) Control
of the economy in event of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That means preliminary planning in case war
should come, and the direction of economy when war had broken
out. In other words, a preparatory period and a later period in
the event of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And, you were asked about your
functions and gave these answers, did you not, “As the Chief of
Staff provides for mobilization from a military point of view...
so you were concerned with it from the economic point of view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You answered, “certainly.” And your
position as Plenipotentiary for War was of equal rank with the
War Ministry, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And, as you told us, those charged
with responsibility in event of war were: First, the Minister of War
and the Chief of the General Staff of the Wehrmacht; and, secondly,
on an equal footing, Dr. Schacht, as Plenipotentiary for Economics.
Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I assume so, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And in January of 1937 you wrote
this, did you not?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I am entrusted with the preparation of the war economy
according to the principle that our economic war organization
must be so organized in time of peace that the war
economy can be directly converted in case of emergency from
this peacetime organization and need not be created at the
outbreak of war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I assume that that is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And who was your Deputy in that
office? Wohlthat?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think Wohlthat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, those being your functions as
Plenipotentiary for the War Economy, let’s turn to your functions
as President of the Reichsbank.
<span class='pageno' title='595' id='Page_595'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>You said that the carrying out of the armament program was
the principal task of the German policy in 1935, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: There is no doubt that you voluntarily
assumed the responsibility for finding financial and economic
means for doing that thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you were the financial and economic
administrator in charge of developing the armament industry
of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You were not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, in no way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I may have misunderstood you.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question: ‘Now, in connection with this development’ ”—I
am referring to your interrogation of the 16th of October 1945,
Exhibit USA-636 (Document Number 3728-PS), Page 44—“ ‘Now
in connection with this development of the armament
industry, you charged yourself as the financial and economic
administrator of it.’</p>

<p>“Nodding your head.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I beg your pardon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Nodding your head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “You charged yourself”—I will ask
the whole question so you will get it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “Now, in connection with this
development of the armament industry, you charged yourself
as the financial and economic administrator of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The record says that you nodded your head. The next question
was:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“And in that connection you took various steps. Would you
be good enough to describe for us the larger steps which you
took with reference to this goal of rearmament, first, internally,
and, second, with respect to foreign nations?</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Internally, I tried to collect all money available
for financing the mefo bills. Externally, I tried to maintain
foreign commerce as much as possible.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you make those answers, and are they correct?
<span class='pageno' title='596' id='Page_596'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I am sure that you are correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And your purpose in maintaining
foreign trade was to obtain enough foreign exchange to permit the
imports of raw materials, not manufactured, which were required
for the rearmament program. Is that not correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is the question that is put to me. Now comes
the answer. Please, will you read the answer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: What is your answer now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: My answer today is that that was not the only aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Not the only aim?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But that was the primary aim, was
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: All right, what was the other aim?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: To keep Germany alive, to assure employment for
Germany, to obtain sufficient food for Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Which was your dominant aim?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: The food supply in Germany and work for the
export industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, I should like to go over one or
two of these documents with you as to your aim. I refer to Document
1168-PS of May 3, 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Title, “Financing of Armament,” Exhibit
Number USA-37.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The following comments are based on the assumption that
the completion of the armament program in regard to speed
and extent is the task of German policy and that accordingly
everything else must be subordinated to this aim, insofar
as this main goal is not endangered, by neglecting other
questions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you write that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Not only did I write it, but I handed it to Hitler
personally. It is one of twin documents, one of which has already
been submitted in evidence and discussed in detail by the Prosecution.
I did not receive the second document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my defense counsel examined me I stated here that I was
intent on stopping the Party collections and Party moneys, which
<span class='pageno' title='597' id='Page_597'></span>
were extracted everywhere from the German people, because it
was extremely difficult for me to get the money to finance the
armament program and the mefo bills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could only get that point across to Hitler if I told him that
of course this was being done in the interests of armament. If
I had told him that this was done...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes, but...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, please let me finish. If I had told him that this
was done for the building of theaters, or something similar, it
would have made no impression on him. However, if I said it
must be done because otherwise we could not arm, that was a
point which influenced Hitler and that is why I said it. I admitted
that and explained it during the examination by my attorney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you didn’t call that misleading
him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I would not call it “misleading”; I would call it
“leading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: But leading without telling him the
true motives which actuated you, at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think you can be much more successful in leading
a person if you do not tell him the truth than if you do tell him
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I am very glad to have that frank
statement of your philosophy, Dr. Schacht. I am greatly indebted
to you. Well, you devised all kinds of plans, one for the control
of foreign exchange, blocked foreign accounts; and mefo bills was
one of the principal ones of your devices for financing was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I don’t care about the details
of mefo bills, but I would like to ask you this. Isn’t it correct, as
you testified in the inquiry of the 16th of October 1945—Exhibit
Number USA-636—as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question: ‘Actually, as a matter of fact, let me ask you this.
At the time when you started the mefo bills, for example,
there were no ready means available for financing the rearmament?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Quite.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘That is to say, through normal budget finance
methods?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Not enough.’
<span class='pageno' title='598' id='Page_598'></span></p>

<p>“Question: ‘Also, you were limited at that time by the statute
of the Reichsbank which did not permit you to give anything
near the sufficient credit which was required by the
armament program.’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Quite.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And you found a way?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘And the way you found was by creating a device
in effect which enabled the Reichsbank to lend, by a subterfuge,
to the Government what it normally or legally could
not do?’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Right.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p>Is that true?</p>

<p>SCHACHT: That was my answer.</p>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The following questions were then
asked:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I understand that basically what was built up in Germany
in the way of an armament industry, a domestic economy
that was sound, and a Wehrmacht, the efforts that you put
in from 1934 to the spring of 1938, when mefo financing
stopped, were responsible in large part for the success of the
whole program.</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I don’t know whether they were responsible for
it, but I helped a great deal to achieve that.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And you were asked as follows, on
the 17th of October 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In other words, in effect you are not taking the position that
you are not largely responsible for the rearming of the
German Army?</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘Oh no, I never did that.’</p>

<p>“Question: ‘You have always been proud of that fact, I
take it.’</p>

<p>“Answer: ‘I wouldn’t say proud, but satisfied.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that still your position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: In reply to that I should like to say: The question
of mefo bills was quite certainly a system of finance which normally
would never have been attempted. I made a detailed statement
on this subject when I was questioned by my attorney. On the
other hand, however, I can say that this question was examined
by all legal experts in the Reichsbank and by means of this
<span class='pageno' title='599' id='Page_599'></span>
subterfuge, as you put it, a way was found which was legally
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: No, I didn’t put it that way; you
said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, no. I mean the sentence you have just quoted
as being my answer. I beg your pardon. The matter was investigated
from a legal viewpoint, and we assured ourselves that it
could be done in this way. Moreover, I am still satisfied today
that I contributed to the rearmament, but I wish that Hitler had
made different use of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, on your 60th birthday Minister
of War Blomberg said that, “Without your help, my dear Mr.
Schacht, there could have been no rearmament,” did he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, those are the sort of pleasantries which one
exchanges on such occasions. But there is quite a bit of truth in
it. I have never denied it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is the way it looks to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, when you finally made some suggestion that the armament
should stop or slow up, as I understand, you made that suggestion
without knowing what the armament was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The only thing you were judging by
was financial conditions, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh, no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, what was it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I did, of course, have a general impression of these
matters because General Thomas always discussed them with me.
However, I do not remember that General Von Blomberg gave
me detailed information about what he thought. Of course, I was
informed in a general way regarding the progress made by the
armament program, and that is why I said “more slowly.” My
opinion was strengthened because of the general conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well now, let’s see what reasons you
gave in Document Number EC-286. That is Exhibit Number
USA-833:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I am therefore of the opinion that we should promote
our export with all resources by a temporary”—and I emphasize
the word “temporary”—“decrease of armament.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Decrease?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Decrease, yes, temporary.
<span class='pageno' title='600' id='Page_600'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: I emphasize “temporary,” and you
emphasize “decrease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh no, no; I agree with you.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: “And that further, with reference
to the Four Year Plan, we should solve only those problems
which appear most pressing. Among these I include the
oil-fuel program, the buna program, and the program of
developing ore resources, insofar as this development does
not of itself require large amounts of raw materials which
must be withheld from export.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, all other measures of the Four Year Plan
should be postponed for the time being. I am convinced
that by such a policy our export could be increased so greatly
that there would be a certain improvement in our exhausted
stocks, and that the resumption of the strengthened armament
would again be possible in the not too distant future, from
the point of view of raw materials. I am unable to judge
to what extent a temporary postponement of armament would
have military advantages. However, I presume that such
a pause in armament would not only have advantages for
the training of officers and men, which has yet to be done,
but that this pause would also afford an opportunity to
survey the technical results of previous armament and to
perfect the technical aspect of armament.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now that you addressed to Göring, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is perfectly possible. I cannot remember the
letter, but it looks quite like one of mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes; and you were correctly giving
to Göring your true views; were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No; I believe that this was merely a tactical letter.
I think that I was mainly trying to limit armament. If I had
told him that we wanted to stop arming, Göring would probably
have denounced me to the Führer accordingly. Therefore I told
him, “Let’s stop for the time being”—temporary. I also emphasize
“temporary.” It was a tactical measure to convince Göring that
for the time being it should be temporary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Then, with your fellow officers in
the Government you were also using tactical statements which did
not represent your true views?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That was absolutely necessary.
<span class='pageno' title='601' id='Page_601'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: When did it cease to be necessary,
Dr. Schacht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Cease?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Yes; when did it cease to be necessary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I think it more important to ask when it commenced;
when it started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: During the first years I did not do it, of course,
but later on I did to a considerable extent. I could say always;
it never stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Has it stopped now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I have no more colleagues, and here before this
Tribunal I have nothing to tell but the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, on the 24th of September,
1935—December—you wrote EC-293, which is Exhibit Number
USA-834, and used this language, did you not:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“If there is now a demand for greater armament, it is, of
course, not my intention to deny or change my attitude,
which is in favor of the greatest possible armament and
which I have expressed for years both before and since
the seizure of power; but it is my duty to point out the
economic limitations of this policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: That is very good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: And that is true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, there came in the Four Year
Plan in 1936?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You did not like the appointment of
Göring to that position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: I thought he was unsuited and, of course, it made
an opening for a policy which was opposed to mine. I knew perfectly
well that this was the start of exaggerated armament, whereas
I was in favor of restricted rearmament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Why do you say that Göring’s appointment
meant exaggeration of armament? Can you point to anything
that Göring has said in favor of rearmament that is any more
extreme than the things you have said?
<span class='pageno' title='602' id='Page_602'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Oh yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, will you do it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: Yes, I think if you read the record of the so-called
“small Ministerial Council,” of the year 1936, and in particular
1938, which you yourself introduced, you will see at once that
here the necessity of increased armament was emphasized. For
instance, those of November or October 1936, I think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well, it was also emphasized in your
documents, was it not, throughout?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You say that your statements of that
sort were merely tactical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, I beg your pardon. I said arm within the
limits of what is economically possible and reasonable. Göring,
if I may say it again, wanted to go beyond those limits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: That is exactly the point I want to
make. Your difference with Göring over rearmament was entirely
a question of what the economy of Germany would stand, was
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No. I said that the most important thing was that
Germany should live and have foreign trade, and within those
limits we could arm. However, it is out of the question that
Germany should arm for the sake of arming, and thus ruin her
economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Well that’s the difference between you
and Göring; it was over what the economy would stand, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SCHACHT: No, it was a question of the extent of rearmament.
The point is, Mr. Justice Jackson, that German economy paid the
price for Göring’s action. The only question is, was it reasonable
or unreasonable? If I may state it pointedly, I would say that I
considered Göring’s economic policy to be unreasonable and a
burden to the German nation; while I considered it most important
that rearmament should not be extended and that the German
nation should have a normal, peacetime standard.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
